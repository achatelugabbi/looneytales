Along with Anita, Rupa hangs out with a group of friends Radha, Ram, Ali and Patel.\r\n\r\nRupa begins to pool up money for her marriage. One fine day, she gets to see the domineering nature of Rahul's mother and confides into Anita about her fears about the marriage. She decides to go ahead with the marriage assuming that Rahul's presence will eventually prevail over his mother's nature. Coincidentally, while they are speak at a temple, they notice a person who seems to be mentally challenged (Anand's father) ogling at them. When Rupa gives him the holy prasadam, he says \"Thank you, Rupa\". Shocked at how he knew Rupa's name, they quickly exit the temple.\r\n\r\nAnand is a happy-go-lucky guy who returns from America.

Madhu's ghost returns from the grave to seek revenge on the family. Rajiv moves with his family to a new place. Raksha and her younger brother Rohan begin exploring the new place and the surroundings- the lonely beach and then the woods behind the house. The terror begins with Raksha and Rohan finding a doll in the woods and then it progresses to a series of highly traumatising experiences for the whole family. \n\nAavaham captures the fear of a family caught hostage to a murderous, animalistic spirit seeking revenge by brutally terrorizing them. We experience a fear far larger than that of a live evil than when the dead returns to haunt you. It is the fear where every escape route of yours becomes dangerously anticipated and cunningly laid out in front of you. It is the fear that extends to letting go of one loved one to save another. Where every situation takes a sinister turn for the worse, methodically murdering everyone's hope to live.\n\nTerrorized by the demonic force, will Rajiv give in to the ghost or will he betray his family and give up? Will the family survive as the gruesome and repulsing murders are committed, or do the disfigured bodies, visions, ghostly voices, and unsettling, disturbing incidents drive them to death? Will the ghost live with them till they become ghosts themselves? The choice that Rajiv has to make in the final moments of the film forms a very unsettling and a highly disturbing climax.","duration":6372.0,"genres":["18","10"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["horror movie, science fiction, scarry movie, Devil movies, Bhooth, Danger, Soul, Aatma, Anveshan, paranormal horror, Aavaham, Avaham full movie - HD quality, aavaham hot kiss scene, phoonk 2, phoonk, ajay devagan, sex scenes, bollywood hot movies, indian horror cinema, indian masala cinema, ram gopal varma movies, rgv movies, hot neeru bajwa, sexy neeru bajwa hot scenes"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iHsNU3sUwU/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:53:06","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iHsNU3sUwU/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iHsNU3sUwU/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:26:33","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iHsNU3sUwU/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:53:06","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iHsNU3sUwU/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:19:39","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iHsNU3sUwU/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Aavaham","title_slug":"aavaham2003","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:12:16Z","video_ids":["4f827dc04597ae3907000063"],"year":2003},{"_id":"4f827dc34597ae3907000066","cast":["Uday Kiran","Vimala","Prakash Raj"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:12:19Z","desc":"Vemana played by Uday Kiran is son of a politician Kalidas.

Ennallakennalakennaalaku is an ageless theme song and Krushi untee will rank as one of the best solo songs.\r\nAnimal stunts (in the film) went a long way in making the producers hit the ball out of the park. The many people who could not afford a circus ticket then, got a chance to watch Elephants do Shiva pooja help the hero take his shower\r\nrescue him several times from the villains etc.\r\n\r\nTo cap it, the movie also has the hero fighting with a lion.\r\nNTR's mass appeal, of course, was the reason behind the super success. Be it in fights (the rope fight in night effect is a classic act), songs (the step where NTR joins both his hands in the air and bends slightly in\r\n\"Aaresukoboyi\"), or in comedy scenes with Sulamiya get up, NTR was at his majestic best.\r\n\r\nIn a nut shell, this is a quintessential commercial film, which continues to allure even the current audience.","duration":9548.0,"genres":["18","1","4"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["NTR, Rama, Rao, Adavi, Ramudu, Jayapradha, TELUGUONE.COM, IDLEBRAIN, GREATANDHRA.COM, TV9, TV-9, GEMINITV, GEMINIMOVIES, ETV, MAATV, TELUGUCINEMA.COM, gulte.com, Raghavendra, Jandhyala, P Susheela, S P Balasubrahmanyam, S Janaki, Padma, Jaya sudha, tdp, chandra babu, N.

He has a loyal group of friends who are determined to make him a responsible guy and therefore desperately try to get him a job somehow. One day, while getting off the bus, he sees a young beautiful girl named Charulatha (Tamannaah) who is also looking for a job, and immediately falls for her. He later gets to spot her at few occasions, trying to follow her, and even misses the interview, his friends had arranged for him, during one such day.\r\nOne day, Shiva goes to the railway station as he is supposed to pick a friend and owner of the car, Shiva and his friends use. While waiting for the friend to arrive, Charulatha, apparently in a very tensed mood, and her uncle, mistaking Shiva to be a cab driver, ask him to drop them at Chennai. Excited to give his dream girl a ride, he accepts and escorts them. They stop at a filling station to refuel the car, when Charulatha suddenly requests Shiva to drive on, losing and leaving her uncle behind. Shiva does as she wishes and takes off without her uncle. She first asks Shiva to drop her at the airport and later at a railway station, but as she misses her flight and is also not able to go by train, she requests Shiva whether he would take her to Mumbai by car.\r\nShiva, immensely thrilled by this request, instantly agrees and escorts her to Mumbai. During the journey she finally reveals her story, after Shiva had asked several times to tell about her problems and the reason for the journey to Mumbai. It comes to light that Charulatha's mother, always supporting her daughter, died after a violent altercation with her father, who since tried to subject Charulatha and make her marry an unknown man he had chosen for her. Not willing to bow his father's wishes, she had escaped from home, but was later found by her father's business partner, Jayaraman, the supposed uncle of her. He was about to take her to the marriage registration arranged by her father, hence Charulatha was trying to escape and insisted on leaving him behind at the filling station. She heads to Mumbai as she wants to stay at her grandmother's home.\r\nHowever, she is followed by a gang, led by a furious Telugu-speaking Amma, whom she and Shiva just about manage to escape. Shiva then decides to change the route in order to avoid the gang, but encounters another gang. He realizes that this gang, however, is not following Charulatha, but himself, as they are the henchmen of a Mumbai-based gangster Baali (Milind Soman). He recalls an incident that happened some years ago in Mumbai, when he stayed there at his friend 's house. He had beaten one of Baali's men, who had attacked him, and later Baali himself, without knowing about him and his reputation in the city, and returned to Bangalore. Both the gangs are now following the couple to achieve their targets. Whether they both can escape both gangs and whether Shiva was able to express his love to Charulatha forms the crux.\r\nIn the end, Shiva manages to save Charulatha from the clutches of Baali and his friends express his feelings to Charulatha who happily accepts Shiva's love for she too had fallen for him during the journey.","duration":8789.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Awaara, Lingu, Swamy, Kaarthi, Thamanna, Yuvan, Shankar, Raja, awara, yuganiki, okkadu, paruthi, veeran, aawara, veedokkade, happydays, kalidasu, ninna, nedu, repu, konchem, ishtam, kashtam, kalasala, vyapari, sree, ananda, thandavam, Deal, seshu, akrosham, chilipi, dhoolpeta, 7g, brindhavana, colony, kalisunte, happy, gayam, vallabha, aadavari, matalaku, arthale, verule, rahu, bhai, deva, sarvam, striker, oy, maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ynLYpTI2FU/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:13:14.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ynLYpTI2FU/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ynLYpTI2FU/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:36:37.250","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ynLYpTI2FU/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:13:14.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ynLYpTI2FU/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:49:51.750","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ynLYpTI2FU/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Awara","title_slug":"awara2010","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:13:43Z","video_ids":["4f827e174597ae39070000b6"],"year":2010},{"_id":"4f827e1c4597ae39070000bb","cast":["Shaam","Simran","Jyothika","Sunil Shetty","Vivek","Moon Moon Sen"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:13:48Z","desc":"Manohar (madhavan) who moves in to a new flat (13, B) along with his huge family.

family. His dreams and aspirations are only to see his brother and two sisters to be happy and settled in life. He falls in love with Priya (Nagma), a wealthy girl who finds Manikyam to be the most admirable man she's ever met. His sister tops her medical exams but can't afford to pay the fees to be admitted in the private college and the Director says that he'll admit her if she agrees to sleep with him. So, Manikyam goes to meet the director in closed doors and when they're out, the director is shook up and readily gives her a free admission. Similar instances compel his cop brother, Shiva, to question his big brother's past. The flashback reveals Manikyam's true identity as Manikyam was a mafia don called Basha, in the city of Bombay. Basha was respected by the public and feared by all wrong-doers. His archenemy, Antony (Raghuvaran) murders his best friend and his father (Vijaykumar), to whom Basha promises to give up the mafia life. He fakes his death to protect his family and assumes the identity of Manikyam, the auto driver. Now, Manikyam finds himself haunted by his past as Antony learns that Basha's still alive and he plans to take his revenge on him.

Tricked into marriage by his convincing mother-in-law, what really irks Bharathi is his wife's inability to deal with his rabid female fans. Tensions escalate until Bharathi flees from home and ends up encountering someone else named Jyothi (Sithara) who's also escaping from her life as a dancer because her husband made her dance forcefully and tried forcing her to be a prostitute. As a rabid fan who gets to marry the object of her desires, she is obviously afraid her husband will cheat on her with one of the thousands of women throwing themselves at him -- after all, he slept with them before their marriage. Rahman, who sounds suspiciously like 'Nizhagal' Ravi, also does well as the famous singer -- but a tiny quibble with the story: he goes to work in a restaurant in North India serving South Indian cuisine, and none of the customers recognize the famous singer. Then, he makes a living in Goa with Jyothi,and meet one Malayali couple what happens next forms the rest of the story.","duration":8939.0,"genres":["18","6","8"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Telugu, Full movies, Movies, Songs, Telugu Masala, Hot Telugu Movies, Tollywood, Music, Boobs, Nipples"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESceJOLsaEA/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:14:29.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESceJOLsaEA/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESceJOLsaEA/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:37:14.750","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESceJOLsaEA/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:14:29.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESceJOLsaEA/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:51:44.250","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESceJOLsaEA/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Bharyalu Jagratha","title_slug":"bharyalu-jagratha1989","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:15:40Z","video_ids":["4f827e8c4597ae3907000127"],"year":1989},{"_id":"4f827e8f4597ae390700012a","cast":["Vijaykanth","Raasi","Khushboo","Radhika Chowdary","Ambika","Vijji","Manorama","Senthil"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:15:43Z","desc":"Sakthivel(Vijayakanth) and Thangarasu(Vijayakanth) are stepbrothers and both are respected by the villagers.

It is intelligently narrated with loads of dialogue from Upendra that is very kicking and peppy for the fans. With major shades of KB's 'Naan Avanillai' the film is polished well to suit the image of Upendra. The purpose of the film is interesting and like a fashion parade Upendra walks away with pretty women perfecting their life at the end in a responsible manner. What is shown in harsh style in 'Naan Avanillai' is commercialized here yet the dignity is maintained.\r\nIn the court hall Panchamrutham (Upendra) is the prime accused according to the police and he is standing before the judge (played by Lakshmi). Panchamrutham claims that he is speaking the language in the accent of the region he belongs to, but the public prosecutor (Siddaraj Kalyankar) places the cases one after the other. In all the cases Panchamrutham says he is not the one who the PP is talking about even though the four ditched women say he is the one cheated. That is the brilliance of Panchamrutham. He is not ready to accept his brother in the court hall and all clues generated go useless. He is such a clever conman with a purpose. He is not after lust or lavish property of all the greedy women he picks up. He wants to teach the woman who are in false prestige. For this he has a horrible story that is told in the flashback.  \r\nWhy Panchamrutham in the get up of Ashok Mittal, Zakir Hussain, Samara Simha Reddy, Shyamprasad, Rajaneesh duped the pretty women and girls is because he wanted to bring them in right order. But with no proof in the court hall he is let free from charges. The police department feels depressed as the judgment in goes favor of Panchamrutham. As a responsible citizen Panchamrutham puts all of them in right order and how he cleverly handles it is high point of the film. \r\nThis film is Upendra all the way. In seven different get ups Upendra not only shines very well but his dialogue is the redeeming feature. He follows the trend he has set in from 'Raktha Kanneeru' and gets wonderful applause for his dialogues which he had written with lyricist Ramanarayan. The five beautiful girls who get grilled intellectually from Upendra -- Suman Ranganath, Brinda, Nathanya, Saloni and Pooja Gandhi are a treat to watch. All of them are beautiful on screen and in a song each with Upendra set the screen on fire. \r\nLakshmi as judge is very apt and Sridhar as Upendra's brother is another right selection. Music director Vijay Anthony is another kicking point with cameraman R.Giri in this film 'Budhimanthudu'.","duration":8253.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["upendra, Sivarajkumar, charmee, jeniffer kotwal, maamovies maatv maa music., maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iC8MQvd-e4/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:08:46.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iC8MQvd-e4/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iC8MQvd-e4/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:34:23.250","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iC8MQvd-e4/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:08:46.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iC8MQvd-e4/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:43:09.750","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iC8MQvd-e4/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Buddhimantudu","title_slug":"buddhimantudu2009","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:15:50Z","video_ids":["4f827e964597ae3907000131"],"year":2009},{"_id":"4f827e984597ae3907000134","cast":["Suresh Gopi","Rajan P Dev","Kalabavan Mani","Cochin Hanifa","Madan","Jagathi Sreekumar","Anoop Chandran","Biju Kuttan"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:15:52Z","desc":"This is an investigative thriller movie.

He meets up with his friend and foster brother, Senthilnathan (Prabhu Ganesan), and his wife, Ganga (Jyothika Saravanan). Senthil and Saravanan's mother Kasturi (K. R. Vijaya) wanted Senthil to marry his paternal aunt, Akhilandeshwari's (Sheela) eldest niece Priya (Malavika), daughter of Kandaswamy (Nasser) to reunite the two families after 30 years of separation. They separated because their father was supposed to marry his intimidating older cousin, Akhilandeshwari, who is the bachelorette family head of her late parents' family, and Priya's paternal aunt and foster mother. However he marries Kasturi. Saravanan learns that they have bought the Vettayapuram Palace, despite a fear of the place and attempts by the elders to dissuade them. Saravanan moves in with them. Akhilandeshwari is jealous of Saravanan and with her assistant, (Sonu Sood) she tries to destroy Saravanan.\r\n\r\nWhen they go to a temple, a priest reveals why everyone is frightened. When King Vettayan lived in the palace, he took a trip to Andhra Pradesh and met the dancer Chandramukhi, instantly falling in love with her beauty. However, she would not return his love because her heart was already set on the dancer Gunasekaran. Vettayan kidnapped her and brought her back to his palace. Chandramukhi, without letting the king know, had Gunasekaran stay in a nearby house. When the king found out, he killed Gunasekaran on Durgashtami and burned Chandramukhi alive. Chandramukhi's spirit continued to remain in the palace so as to take revenge on the king. Legend had it that her soul was locked up in the southern room along with a king cobra. Shortly afterward, Saravanan helps Priya with her love affair with their neighbour, dance professor Viswanathan (Vineeth), and persuades her parents and aunt to speak with him to arrange their marriage.\r\n\r\nWhen Ganga learns of Chandramukhi's story, she wants to go to Chandramukhi's room because she thinks that this story was made up to scare thieves from stealing costly treasures which she believes is in Chandramukhi's room. She gets the key and opens the door. Subsequently, strange things begin happening in the household: a ghost is scaring the people in the house, things are inexplicably breaking, and Ganga's sari catches on fire. Suspicion turns towards Durga (Nayantara), the gardener's granddaughter. Senthil calls Saravanan for help with the mysterious events. The night Saravanan returned , a mysterious being made an attempt to kill Priya. As someone tries to kill Senthil, once with poison, and another time by pushing a fish tank a mysterious voice sings in the middle of the night, and Saravanan tries to figure out what's happening. The night of Priya and Viswanathan's wedding reception, Ganga mysteriously disappears from the canopy. When Saravanan notices he goes to look for her. But he ends up almost getting killed by the goon sent by Akhilandeshwari for arranging her niece's marriage. He knocks the goon out, and with Senthil's help, they find Ganga, supposedly being sexually harassed by Viswanathan. Saravanan then informs Senthil and Viswanathan that Ganga has split personality of Ganga and Chandramukhi. The reason she tried to kill Priya and Senthil, and frame Viswanathan for sexual harassment was because in Chandramukhi's eyes, Viswanathan is her lover Gunasekaran, who looks just like him. The only way to stop it is to make her believe Saravanan is dead. This is because Chandramukhi was killed by King Vettayan, who looked just like him. Then Saravanan says that he will act as the king and let Chandramukhi kill him and get Chandramukhi out of Ganga's body, with the help of world-renown exorcist Ramachandra Acharya. The reason he will sacrifice his life is because he looks just like the king and he went up to Chandramukhi's room and she saw him. Akhilandeshwari hears his idea, realising that she was wrong to try to destroy Saravanan and begs him for forgiveness. Later, in the dance hall, the family and Ramachandra Acharya did what Saravanan asked them to do. They let Chandramukhi pour oil on him so she can burn him alive and when she lights the match, Ramachandra Acharya blows the smoke and ash in her face. Then Senthil opens a trapdoor to let Saravanan fall down and a cardboard figure of him gets burnt. Chandramukhi thinks that the king is dead and leaves Ganga's body. Ganga is cured. After 30 years of separation, the two families are reunited. Saravanan and Durga have a love affair. And finally, Sorna and Murugesh (Vadivelu) are parents after 8 years of marriage","duration":10045.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Prabhu Jyothika, maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XtgS9cFFvBA/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:23:42.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XtgS9cFFvBA/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XtgS9cFFvBA/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:41:51.250","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XtgS9cFFvBA/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:23:42.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XtgS9cFFvBA/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"02:05:33.750","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XtgS9cFFvBA/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Chandramukhi","title_slug":"chandramukhi2005","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:16:07Z","video_ids":["4f827ea74597ae3907000141"],"year":2005},{"_id":"4f827ea94597ae3907000144","cast":["Mammootty","Raghuvaran","Showkar Janaki","Jagadish","Vinodini","Anugraha"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:16:09Z","desc":"Chantoodu -Ukrosham Chantoodu is a 2002 critically acclaimed Telugu movie by Vijay starring Mammootty in the title role.

It revolves around six characters & their choice of making careers and settling down in United States or in homeland (India).\r\n\r\nthe film revolves around six characters faced with the choice of making careers, and homes, for themselves in the States, or staying on in India. Ravi, thus, is US-bound, flying in the face of his parents' grief at his departure. Balu is determined to follow his footsteps. Phani hesitates on the verge of making the same choice. Srinu, the rebel, is the exception, preferring to study management in India. Sardar dreams of expanding his family business. And Usha, the only girl in the group, is busy with a project that involves interviewing the US-bound. The film starts rather jerkily but, once the characters settle down, it becomes engrossing. The director sets his characters against the backdrop of middle class Hyderabadi society and its magnificent obsession with the US, the H-1 visa and the Green Card. As typified by this couple who are heading off to the States just so their first child can be born there -- and thus become, automatically, an American citizen. \r\n\r\nThe conflict in the film is between the dollar dreams and human feelings. What, the film asks -- and tries to answer -- happens to those who are left behind, to the aged parents deprived of the support they had taken for granted? Ravi's father, thus, suffers a heart attack. The son does not return and the old man is taken care of by friends. When Ravi finally returns, he finds he cannot adjust to the conditions he was brought up in. His choice is made and his return to the States is inevitable. \r\n\r\nCan money change human nature to such an extent? Yes, if you look at Ravi. No, if you consider Balu -- who, on the verge of taking his flight, decides to tear up his travel documents and stay back, to get into business with Sardar. \r\n\r\nSrinu, meanwhile, fails to get admission into the management institute. His father believes there is no scope for his son in India, but he prefers to hang on, figuring there is always another chance. \r\n\r\nUsha, meanwhile, prefers to take notes, rather than take sides. \r\n\r\nThe film is of, and for, a young audience and sets dollars against culture to provide the conflict.

His father Manivannan a quarry worker in Cuddappa has captivated under baddies like Suman, Ashish Vidyarti & Co.\r\n\r\none of his father's creditors tries to vacate Vijay and his family. To settle his amount, Vijay flies to Malaysia with a dishonoured cheque given by his father's debtor, and traced out him, who is none other than Suman.\r\n\r\nAfter a fierce fight with him, Vijay takes away a rare diamond of Suman and also steals his sister's (Trisha) heart and returns to Chennai and rest of the story is all about how all ends well. \r\n Vijay having to free his father and his colleagues who have been trapped as slaves under villains Ashish Vidyarthi and Suman forms the crux of Kuruvi. The director has attempted to ride on the twin horses of action and comedy, moving the film at a very rapid pace, while simultaneously depicting Vijay at his humorous best. However, his objective seems to be too elusive and the film sags at various levels. Ashish Vidyarthi and Suman (Sivaji fame) are compatriots in the quarry business who have given out a contract to Vijay's dad,Manivannan, in Cudappa, Andhra Pradesh. Diamonds that are otherwise only found in Africa are said to be located in this area, but the government issues a ban to excavate the place owing to the risk of earthquakes. But the baddies force Manivannan to go against the law and make him and his group bonded laborers. Manivannan challenges the villains that his son would avenge him once he learns of this. But Vijay, who is in Chennai, thinks that his dad has gone under cover due to debts and is hopeful of his return one day. Meanwhile, a cheque for 50 lakhs that Manivannan had issued as collateral towards the house, bounces-forcing Vijay to vacate their house. Vijay asks the landlords a week's time to pay back the money and sets out on a mission to Malaysia to find the person whose signature is on the cheque. \r\nHe travels to Malaysia as a kuruvi- one who is used as a runner to carry and bring back goods.

The director weaves a love story that breathes fire, pride in the face of human vulnerabilities. Gangaputrulu, the sons of the sea is an apt title for the movie based on the fishermen and their community. It is second in trilogy by the director who addresses the problems of the fishermen, throws a platform for debate, shows a solution and leaves you judgemental.\r\n\r\nHe shows the woman as being strong in the film vis-\u00e0-vis the man who runs away from responsibilities and imminent burden. The last scene in the film is a highlight that speaks volume of the mind of fishermen who live and die by the sea. The rest of the story shows how mechanized fishing has become a bane rather than a boon stripping the folks of their livelihood. There is inherent humour, there is pathos, there is a sweet love story of a woman who tries to seduce her man by dolling herself with talcum powder, lipstick and other accessories just because he expresses his disgust for marrying and leading a life with a woman who smells of fish.\r\n\r\nRao Ramesh as the head of a television channel lends dignity to his role, Gayatri Rao as a journalist who's initially flippant, insensitive and careless in her attitude to fishermen and later realizes the true story provides an insight to their pressures of bringing a story, their wear and tear adds a whiff of freshness. Her conversation with Tanmayee is worth noting. Ramki looks sensitive though he has a huge brawn, both the debutants and the rest of the newcomers look real people from the community, the costumes, the slang everything is near perfect.\r\n\r\nSome frames the awkwardness is visible but it is seriously a commendable job. All of them show immense potential, great future for niche subjects. Cinematography is beatific, music and lyrics lovely. Just go, fall in love with the vizag waters and the blemishless, beautiful fish and fishermen. FYI, thanks to Sunil Kumar Reddy for a satisfying platter.","duration":6783.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Ganga, Puthrulu, subba, raju, gayathri, sunil, kumar, reddy, praveen, immadi, basi, ravindrababu, ramki, thanmayee, maatv, maa, serials, movies, msuic, entertainment"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YsksA641L5A/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:56:31.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YsksA641L5A/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YsksA641L5A/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:28:15.750","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YsksA641L5A/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:56:31.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YsksA641L5A/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:24:47.250","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YsksA641L5A/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Gangaputrulu","title_slug":"gangaputrulu2011","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:18:49Z","video_ids":["4f827f494597ae39070001df"],"year":2011},{"_id":"4f827f4c4597ae39070001e2","cast":["Karthik","Nirosha","Prabhu","Amala","Vijay Kumar","Jayachitra"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:18:52Z","desc":"Gharshana - Full Length Telugu Movie - 1988 Producer : G.

Siddharth and Lara fall for each other. He has another face too. He murders all criminal lawyers who appear for the thug, corrupt politicians and other anti socials elements. First he murders cleverly the famous criminal lawyer Anadaraj who appears for a goonda by hitting him with a cricket ball and the police close the file as a case of accident. Then it was Saranraj's turn. He also gets killed and Nazar, an army Major is a witness to it. The killing spree continues. Lawyer Devan becomes the next in his target. Siddharth caught red-handed by Nazar is forced to narrate why he turned ruthless against all lawyers who misuse the law. The story unfolds in a flash back. His father (director P.Vasu) was an upright and honest judge who was brutally murdered by a local goon and contractor Muthupandi (Rajan.P.Dev) in a running train while he tries to appear on a case against the thug. His mother also dies in the attack and his only sister (Abhitha) escapes. Criminal lawyer (Devan) appears in the case and helps Muthupandi and his men to come out of the case. \r\nThis incident makes Siddharth to become fixated to provide 'instant justice' to lawyers who argue and win cases of criminals. (So the catch line -- 'When Justice fails...' is justified). One day a lawyer from Delhi (Raghuvaran) comes to defend a rapist, as criminal lawyers in Chennai are frightened to take up the case. Siddharth plots to kill him but gets shocked when he finds out that the Delhi lawyer is none other than the husband of his lost sister. Now in the melodrama that sparks off between the two, Raghuvaran finds out that Siddharth is the culprit behind the recent murders. Despite all odds how Siddharth manages to kill Raghuvaran in the climax and justifies his action at the end forms the rest of the story.","duration":9162.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Action King Arjun, Lara Dutta, Anand Raj, Manivannan, S.Ve.

But he ends up in returning to city with Gopika herself for she comes to know of the bridegroom's bad past in the village just before the marriage.\r\n\r\nFriends since their childhood days, the couple begins to live in a small house owned by Vivek in Chennai. Meanwhile, Bhaskar, a research scholar in Chemistry, succeeds in coming out with a prototype of a desalination plant which he wants to give to the government and solve the water crisis in Chennai.He eventually gets discouraged by the government authorities and even the State Minister. He then decides to prove everyone wrong and plans to set up his own desalination plant based on the methods of his research. Along with Archana, he runs from pillar to post for loan. In between, the couple falls in love and ties the knot.\r\n\r\nEnters Madan (Prithviraj), a college mate of Archana, Madan gets acquainted with their family. Coming to know of their troubles, the rich Madan volunteers to help them and even lends money. All troubles begin only now. Madan happens to be a 'business consultant' who lends money to companies, corporates and individuals at exorbitant rates of interest and uses his might to recover them.\r\n\r\nIn Bhaskar's case, he begins to trouble them demanding his money back and threatens to take over the research works of Bhaskar with which he aspires to make a huge sum.The movie after several twists and turns ends on a happy note.\r\n\r\nSrikanth has played his part well. With enough scope for romance and action, he enjoys the role. Gopika has taken the glamour route and seems to have gone liberal in romantic scenes. At the same time, towards the second half, she turns fiery, and deserves a special mention for that.\r\n\r\nAll credit should go to Prithviraj. He has done his role not just with ease but also stamped his class all through. He seems to have fitted the character well and his handsome looks combined with his villainous deeds make him a treat to watch. Vivek has played his part well. However too much of double meaning dialogues from him is slightly surprising.","duration":9134.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Karthavyam, Sriram, Gopika, Anand, vivek, maatv, maa, serials, movies, music, entertainment, Singers, Sayonara, Philips, Tippu, Sunitha, Sarathy, Manikka, inayagam, Srinivas, Kalyani, Udit, Narayan, Prithviraj, Thyagarajan, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m_-f5jx8ATw/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:16:07","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m_-f5jx8ATw/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m_-f5jx8ATw/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:38:03.500","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m_-f5jx8ATw/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:16:07","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m_-f5jx8ATw/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:54:10.500","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m_-f5jx8ATw/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Karthavyam","title_slug":"karthavyam2005","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:22:50Z","video_ids":["4f82803a4597ae39070002bf"],"year":2005},{"_id":"4f82803c4597ae39070002c2","cast":["Kalyan Ram","Sana","Shyam","Saranya Mohan","Kota Srinivasa Rao","Ahuti Prasad","Ajay","Chandra Mohan"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:22:52Z","desc":"Rama Krishna (Kalyan Ram Nandamuri) is a football player who aspires to play for national team.

Laya, the daughter of a drunkard (Bharani) is a state ranker in intermediate with aspirations of becoming a doctor. Rajasekhar finances her education and later even builds a hospital for her. Laya worships him out of gratitude but Rajashekar misinterprets it as love. Meanwhile, Laya's marriage is fixed with an MLA's son but before it takes place, thanks to Rajashekar, the bridegroom's true colours are exposed. By this time Laya also starts loving the hero and the film moves to a predictable end. Somewhere in between all this is introduced the character of Asha Saini, the mandatory second heroine, which has become a regular feature of all Telugu films now.\r\nInspite of the routine storyline, its narration makes the film watchable.

In the 1980s a man named Raghava Rao gets into a fight with his cousin and is stabbed but kills his cousin with a hatchet. The victim's brother Ramineedu and his sons swear that they will kill Raghava Rao and all his family. Raghava Rao returns home with a knife in his chest and asks to take his son. His wife doesn't want her son to be involved and refuses. She sends him away to Hyderabad. 20 years later, the son, Ramanna, is a bicycle courier who always ends up delivering his wares late. His boss claims that until he buys an auto rickshaw to go faster, he will not have a job. As Ramanna comes home, a letter arrives notifying him that he has inherited land in Rayalaseema. His uncle warns him, saying that his parents sent him away because of big trouble, and that he should not go back. Ramanna scoffs and doesn't believe there will be a problem after such a long time. As he gets on the train to Rayalaseema, he befriends a girl named Aparna. After many antics on the train, they arrive. Aparna's sketchbook slips from her bag and Ramanna tries to get it. By the time he finds it, the train has left the station and Aparna is gone. Ramanna gets down at the next stop and asks for a ride into town. A man named Mallasuri, elder son of Ramineedu, gives him a ride to town and lets him off with a young guide who shows Ramanna around town. Mallasuri overhears their conversation and learns that Ramanna is the son of Raghava Rao. Mallasuri tries to catch Ramanna, but loses him. Meanwhile, Ramanna is told that the way to consolidate his property and sell it is to visit Ramineedu, not knowing who he is. Ramanna ventures to Ramineedu's house and is surprised to find Aparna there, who is the daughter of Ramineedu. While they are eating lunch, Mallasuri comes home, takes his father and his younger brother Baireddy aside and reveals who Ramanna is. The father maintains a doctrine of hospitality and respect to his guests and will not kill him inside his home. Therefore, they have to wait until he steps out of the house. While playing a game with Ramineedu's grandchildren, Ramanna comes across a photo album with pictures of his parents together with Ramineedu and his brother. He deduces that the murder of Ramineedu's brother is the trouble for which his mother sent him away and finds out that he must stay inside the house. He says many goodbyes to delay his departure bit sustains a back injury from a loose swing. Ramineedu discovers that Ramanna cut the ropes to the swing and faked injury in order to stay inside.\r\n\r\nThe next few moments are filled with schemes by Ramanna to stay in the house as long as possible. Aparna is expected to marry her cousin by her family they think of each other too much as brother and sister to do so. Her cousin is convinced that Ramanna is in love with Aparna and misunderstands his attempts to stay in the house as attempts to stay with Aparna. Ramanna tries to get Aparna and her cousin married so he can stay for the wedding. Her cousin, through Ramanna's actions, falls in love with Aparna and agrees to marriage. While everyone is preparing for marriage, Ramanna hides in a basket but is seen by Baireddy. As the baskets are taken out of the house, Baireddy cuts that basket only to find it filled with flowers. In reality, Ramanna switched baskets after overhearing Baireddy's conversation. He runs out of the house and is followed by Baireddy and Mallasuri. After a long chase, he ends up at a bridge where Aparna helps him get across and block the bridge from further crossing. However, he realizes that Aparna loves him and decides to stay with her rather than running away from love. Ramineedu and his sons start to beat up Ramanna but he doesn't let go of her hand. Unable to take it, Aparna jumps off the bridge into the river and Ramanna goes in after her and brings her ashore. The family realizes Aparnas and Ramanna's love for each other and quite decide to \"bury the hatchet\" and let them marry.","duration":7476.0,"genres":["18","4","6"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Maryada Ramanna, Ravi, Teja, Cycle, Sunil, S S Rajamouli, Magadheera, Sye, Eega, Simhadri, Yama Donga, Saloni, Aparna, Ramineedu, Supreet, Ajay, Anuj Gurwara, telugu ammayi, rao ramesh, m m keeravani, ananth sriram, rama rajamouli, telugu, folklore, maatv, comedy, drama, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MvG_fBTU7p4/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:02:18","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MvG_fBTU7p4/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MvG_fBTU7p4/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:31:09","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MvG_fBTU7p4/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:02:18","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MvG_fBTU7p4/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:33:27","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MvG_fBTU7p4/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Maryada Ramanna","title_slug":"maryada-ramanna2010","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:41:22Z","video_ids":["4f8284924597ae3929000026"],"year":2010},{"_id":"4f8284974597ae3929000029","cast":["ANR","Anjali Devi","Mukkamala"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:41:27Z","desc":"Princess of a kingdom Indumati (Anjali Devi) falls in love with a brave boy Pratap (A.N.R)The queens brother Bhaskar (Mukkamala) kidnaps her when goes out of the fort with her maid servant Lavangi.Bhaskar warns Indumati that he would torture them and ultimately kill them if she (Anjali Devi) rejects his marraige proposal.However A.N.R with the help of the maid servant Lavanagi saves the pricess as she (Lavangi) knows where Bhaskar had kept the pincess (Indumati).On their return to the kingdom the couple face many problems.A tantric kidnaps A.N.R ask him for a help he leaves him with no choice rather to accept him.The tantric kills him and brings him back to life.In this process Anjali Devi is saved by tribal people.How A.N.R and Anjali devi get back to kingdom,how A.N.R takes over the charge as king forms the intresting part of the story.","duration":6277.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["mayala mari, mayalamari, mayalamari full movie, mayala mari cinema, mayalamari telugu movie, indian classic movies, indian retro movies, indian old movies, indian cinema, telugu movies, telugu cinema, fantasy cinema, indian fantasy cinema"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SitZVUhnB-A/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:52:18.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SitZVUhnB-A/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SitZVUhnB-A/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:26:09.250","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SitZVUhnB-A/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:52:18.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SitZVUhnB-A/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:18:27.750","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SitZVUhnB-A/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Mayalamari","title_slug":"mayalamari1951","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:41:27Z","video_ids":["4f8284974597ae3929000028"],"year":1951},{"_id":"4f8284994597ae392900002b","cast":["Rajendra Prasad","Naresh","Raghu Babu","Krishna Bhagavan","Ravi Kondala Rao","Chinna","Radha Kumari","Ali"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:41:29Z","desc":"Elderly Rajaji (Rajendra Prasad) does not have any dependents as both his wife and daughter die. \r\nHis daughter takes her life because of the rejection from her boy friend.

After around a decade, he becomes Rajeev Kanakala, and after he is released, as his mother crosses the road to hug him, she gets tossed around by a dozen trucks, and hurtles to her death.\n\nThe grief-stricken Seenu mopes around, and in a fight sequence, he wins the heart of the flashy, curvy and rose-lipped Vasu (Harish), who introduces him to his family. His sister ties Seenu a rakhi, and his mother feeds him payasam. Vasu shows him his room. And Vasu takes him to a Friendship Day function. And Vasu offers to buy him a bike. And Vasu takes him to Araku Valley. And Vasu can't keep his hands off Seenu. Is this friendship? We hope so!\n\nSeenu is smitten by a girl who he keeps seeing on the road and in the temple, but he has no clue of what her name is, where she lives, what she does for a living etc. Vasu knows Seenu is in love with this dame, Sandhya, but befriends her and even helps her out in her search for a subject for an biography she plans to write.\n\nThe villain plays with Seenu's head by telling him his friend is a traitor. Seenu doesn't believe it at first, but he too sees them 'moving closely', and is furious. First his father, then his mother, and now this. Why does Seenu always end up lonely? How come love evades him? Given the fun that all those couples, who pay to sit in dumps that screen duds like these, are having, Seenu might as well be on the other side of the screen. \n\nOn second thoughts, in that case, there would have been no dud to screen, and no dumps for couples to sit in and have fun, so Seenu does the mature and sensible thing and gets back to reality, and drives his Sumo - anonymously - over Vasu. Anonymously, because he wears sunglasses while doing it.\n\nIt turns out that Vasu was trying to make Sandhya fall in love with Seenu, but everyone misunderstood. Seenu, of course, knows nothing of all this, is still seething with rage at Vasu, and tries to court Sandhya, who doesn't know he's her 'subject'.\n\nBut Vasu is so nice that though he knows Seenu did it, all he's worried about is how he is doing.

The director tries to tell us that it is because of the singsong hawking talent of Ganesh that even though Giri Babu has just one bus, his collection matches that of all the buses owned by his rival Kaka Krishna Murthy.

Guru and his friend Pooja who looks more like a fashion model find out that a girl is getting some unusual dreams and she is leaking out these dreams to the rival newspaper editor. Since all these dreams become a reality, the newspaper is always on target.\r\n\r\nOne day this girl gets a dream where she is engaged to Guru and she falls for him. Guru wants to disprove that all the incidents that have happened are coincidental and is working on his own way to find out the truth behind some murders.

But the finesse of the Malayalam films is not seen in \"News\", which has some cheap sequences.\r\n\r\nUpendra who has played the role of Guru has to fight, make love with two glamorous girls and also engage himself in comedy sequences featuring Tennis Krishna and Bank Janardhan. Upendra excels in all of them, but if at all the director had been little more circumspect he would not have included some below the best sequences in the film.\r\n\r\nStill \"News\" may be a worthy viewing exercise for many reasons. The songs are well choreographed and are a major attractive feature of the film. Upendra as an investigative journalist-though he does little of journalist's duties and more of policing work delivers a better performance. Malayalam actress Renuka Menon has done her role adequately, but Reema Sen has nothing much to do except singing some songs and adding some oomph into the film. Tennis Krishna's comedy is in bad taste. Ashok and Nasser have come out with decent performances.","duration":7716.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["News, maatv, maa, serials, movies, music, entertainment, Upendra, Reema, Sen, Renuka, Menon, Nasser, Ashok, Avinash, Tennis, Krishna, Bank, Janardhan, Maheshwar, Guru, Kiran, Senthil, Kumar"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NTgv0BQTj3k/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:04:18","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NTgv0BQTj3k/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NTgv0BQTj3k/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:32:09","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NTgv0BQTj3k/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:04:18","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NTgv0BQTj3k/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:36:27","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NTgv0BQTj3k/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"News","title_slug":"news2005","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:42:27Z","video_ids":["4f8284d34597ae3929000064"],"year":2005},{"_id":"4f8284d54597ae3929000067","cast":["Chandra Mohan","Jayasudha","Mohan Babu","Baby Rekha","Baby Sudha","Ali","Suryakala","Janaki"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:42:29Z","desc":"Nindu Noorellu (1979) is directed by K.

She brokers deals with the buyers and sellers and gets paid commissionwise. She arranges a deal between Gowri Shankar (Suman) of Sri Venkateswara Bank, Hyderabad, and a Seth (Raghubabu) in Mumbai, for the sale of a guest house in Mumbai. As per the agreement, there is three months time for registration. However, Gowri Shankar's son Kiran (T. Gopichand) comes to Mumbai and demands the money immediately. Though Gauthami tries very hard to convince Kiran that it may not be possible to complete the deal early, the latter did not listen and want to complete the deal saying that he needed urgently needed money.\r\nOn the other hand, there is a mafia don called Sonu Bhai (Mahesh Manjrekar), who needs an urgent heart transplantation and looks for a person who has a typical blood group called Bombay blood Group. Despite several efforts, the entire mafia gang was not able to get a person with that rare blood group. Incidentally, Kiran has the same blood group and the goons catch him. However, Kiran escapes as he was alerted by the nephew of Sonu Bhai (Rahul Dev), who eyed his property. From then on the chase begins between Kiran, Gauthami and Sonu Bhai's men. In fact, Kiran's father Gowrishankar who started a private bank suffers losses.\r\nThe customers attack the bank on learning about the losses demanding the return of their deposits. In order to recoup from it, he needs urgent deposits from other banks to safeguard the interests of the customers. Kiran and Gowrishankar approach a finance secretary Janakiram (Tanikella Bharani) in the Central government who could influence the RBI and he demands Rs 4 crore as bribe. So Kiran reaches Mumbai to collect the sale proceeds which could be given to him. Now, Sonu Bhai's friend Jayadev (Nassar) calls up Chandrasekhar and promises Rs 200 crore deposit. Following a call from his father Kiran meets Jayadev and Sonubhai, who agree to deposit the money but in return wanted Kiran's heart. After a lot of mental struggle, Kiran decides to take away the money as Sonubhai is threatening the Seth against buying his guest house. Finally, Kiran goes to Sonubhai's hotel and takes away Rs 100 crore by thrashing all his goons. He also destroys the lifesaving machine arranged to Sonubhai. The film ends with the death of Sonubhai and Jayadev's suicide as he could not stop Kiran.","duration":7175.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Okkadunnadu, Yeleti, Chandrasekhar, Gopichand, Neha, Jhulka, M.M.Keeravani, Wanted, lakshyam, golimaar, shankam, ranam, shouryam, yagnam, Viyyalavari, kayyalu, magadheera, yamadonga, chatrapathi, eega, panchadara, bomma, vedam, naa, autograph, agni, skalana, sye, simhadri, ramadasu, pandurangadu, annamayya, allari, priyudu, mogudu, maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5AR9laYlXbQ/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:59:47.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5AR9laYlXbQ/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5AR9laYlXbQ/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:29:53.750","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5AR9laYlXbQ/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:59:47.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5AR9laYlXbQ/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:29:41.250","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5AR9laYlXbQ/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Okkadunnadu","title_slug":"okkadunnadu2007","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:43:21Z","video_ids":["4f8285094597ae392900009a"],"year":2007},{"_id":"4f82850b4597ae392900009d","cast":["Gopi Chand","Bhavana","Sunil","Ali","Ajay","Ashish Vidyarthi","Raghu Babu","Rajiv Kanakala"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:43:23Z","desc":"Muddu Krishna (Paruchuri Venkateswara Rao) is a happy father with his three sons.

He has gone through 9 loves in his life, and thinks that love between two people eventually dies out. As a person with strong morals, he is honest and wants to love life and live with open mind, open thought and open action with his lover. Jaanu (Genelia D'Souza) studies in the same college as Ram. He falls in love with her at first sight and goes onto wooing her. She eventually ends up falling for him, but wants him to promise to love her forever. Ram, of course, nonchalantly dismisses this and explains how he cannot love her forever. This leads to a clash of their ideologies. Ram shows Jaanu how even true love stales after a while and true love cannot stay forever, while Jaanu shows him examples of everlasting love, like her friends and her parents. However he makes it clear that love between two people is never the same as it first is.\r\n\r\nAbhishek makes Ram tell him why he feels like this, and Ram explains another love in his life, Rooba (Shazahn Padamsee). He falls in love with her as she visits Hyderabad when Ram is on a foreign exchange project. He follows her to Mumbai and they both fall in love. However as time passes, the couple faces problems and Ram feels himself lying more and more just to make Rooba happy. Unable to take it anymore, he tells her that he cannot continue loving her if he has to lie and sacrifice so much for her. They break up, and through the experience Ram becomes the man he is.\r\n\r\nHe returns to the story of Jaanu who is with him but is troubled that he cannot promise his love forever. Ram notices his neighbor's (Nagendra Babu) relationship with his wife. The husband fights with his wife a lot, but they still are very much in love and cannot leave each other. Through this, and other instances he realizes that in love, some sacrifices must be made and he must look beyond small arguments and fights and see the whole \"ocean\" of the relationship. Ram tries winning back Jaanu, and argues that while he cannot promise to love her forever, he will try his best. This does not seem to be enough for Jaanu, however.\r\n\r\nAbhishek talks to Ram and understands his problem with love.

If K Vishwanath is a doyen for Telugu cinema, K Balachandar holds the forte in Tamil cinema. Remember some of his Telugu movies like Anthuleni Katha and Amma Katha? Well he is back to the big screen after successful television serials, in the Temal - Telugu bilingual Paravasam.The tale revolves around four key characters - Dr. Madhava (Mahdavan), Simi Sheela (Sneha) and Andam (Lawrance). Madhava is a doctor who becomes an overnight star thanks to acting in one film. His tryst with tinsel town makes him a household name and heartthrob of young girls.Madhava webs Simi. They lead a happy married life almost a year until Rekha, a college friend of Madhava visits them. Rekha reveals that she and Madhava had a child out of wedlock. At first, Simi dismisses Rekha as someone trying to create havoc in her celebrity\\'s husband\\'s life. Hell breaks lose after Maddy accepts the fact. Simi opts for a divorce. Meanwhile, Simi loses her father, her only support, in an accident. She is left with loads of debt to clear. Madhava helps her out of the crisis and protects her from miscreants. They grow to love each other after divorce but are hesitant to reveal themselves. In a turn of events, Simi thinks that Madhava loves Sheela. With no hopes of living with Madhava, she decides to wed the fusion dancer Andam, whom she had known before.Madhava who still loves Simi is shocked by her decision but goes all out to make her happy and arranges for her second marriage. Meanwhile, Simi wants Madhava to wed Sheela. Both the weddings are scheduled at the same venue. Do Maddy and Simi come together in all this confusion?It\\'s the director\\'s 100th film and marks his return to silver screen after a hiatus of five years. As always, he excels in the deft use of symbolism to convey messages. The meeting between Madhavan and Simran at the isolated railway station first before marriage and again before divorce is a classical example. Lyricist Vaali chips in with a short role trying to cement the straining relationships.Madhavan essays his part with effortless brilliance. He excels as the heartthrob in the first half and as a pining husband in the latter half. It\\'s been quite sometime since we have seen Simran as her usual self. This is one more feather to her cap after Vaali, Kalisundam Raa and Nuvvu Vastavani. Choreographer Lawrance comes up with a good performance with his fusion dance. But, the song in climax just gets on to your nerves.AR Rehman\\'s music score has some catchy songs. The melodious Chelia Kusalama by SPB and Sadhana sargam is the best of the lot. The sluggish editing is a sore point of an otherwise technically good film. The climax is too lengthy and tests your patience.","duration":8800.0,"genres":["18","6","8"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["HERO, HEROIN, ACTOR, ACTORS, ACTRESS, DIRECTOR, MUSIC, DANCE, TELUGUSONGS, TELUGU, HOT, SONGS, HIT, VIDEOS, VIDEO, SONG, TELUGUONE.COM, IDLEBRAIN, GREATANDHRA.COM, TV9, TV-9, GEMINITV, GEMINIMOVIES, ETV, MAATV, GOLTI, TELUGUCINEMA.COM, gulte.com, 123telugu.com"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcSNBoqpFXc/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:13:20","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcSNBoqpFXc/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcSNBoqpFXc/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:36:40","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcSNBoqpFXc/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:13:20","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcSNBoqpFXc/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:50:00","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcSNBoqpFXc/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Paravasam","title_slug":"paravasam2001","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:43:54Z","video_ids":["4f82852a4597ae39290000ba"],"year":2001},{"_id":"4f82852d4597ae39290000bd","cast":["Suman","Suresh","Malashri","Lakshmi","Srividya","Raj Kumar","Srinadh","Babu Mohan"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:43:57Z","desc":"Daggubati Ramanaidu (Telugu: \u0c26\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c41\u0c2c\u0c3e\u0c1f\u0c3f \u0c30\u0c3e\u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41) (born 6 June 1936) is an Indian movie producer.Suresh Productions (Telugu: \u0c38\u0c41\u0c30\u0c47\u0c37\u0c4d \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c4a\u0c21\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c37\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c38\u0c4d) is a film production company founded by Dr. D.

She asks Saroja to leave the house immediately. Bhaskar gets very furious and scolds Geeta and tells her about her sister's great sacrifice. Geeta feels extremely guilty and falls sick. She asks Bhaskar to go and search for her sister and then she dies before he finds her. By the time Bhaskar finds Geeta, she unwillingly marries Jaggaiah who is a doctor because she lost her love.

'Pourudu' is a story that takes you through the story of father Pandu (Suman) and son Ajay (Sumanth). Though it does feel like you have watched it before, Raaj Aditya manages to hold the attention of the audience with tight screenplay. Of course, the film goes a full circle and shows that the only way to fight the unsocial elements is by staying out of the system.\r\n\r\nThe film starts off on a regular note where Ajay is happy after finding his name among the top ten, who get through the Civil Services examination. On the other side of the spectrum is Pandu, who bashes up all those who are against Bhai (Nazir). Despite all the love between the father and son, Pandu's affinity towards Bhai results in a series of misunderstandings between him and Ajay. Time and again, Ajay ends up being humiliated due to his father's blind belief in Bhai. One such incident leads to both Pandu and Ajay landing up in jail. From here on, the story moves forward and the awaited twist in the tale comes.\r\n\r\nIn between the bash ups and lock ups, Ajay falls in love with Samyukta or Samyu (Kajal Agarwal), which lead to dream song sequences in exotic locales. Thankfully, the locations are new, though two songs look almost similar. Samyu's parents too surprisingly understand Ajay's plight and support him, unlike the usual filmi parents who end up creating a fracas.","duration":8691.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Pourudu, Raj, Aditya, Sumanth, Kajol, Manisharma, perma, katha, yuvakudu, godavari, boni, golkonda, high, school, satyam, madhumasam, class, mates, raaj, maya, magadheera, chandamama, aarya, darling, om, shanti, brindavanam, shakti, kushi, athadu, takkari, donga, bavagaru, bagunnara, jai, chiranjeeva, tagore, khaleja, kathi, don, seenu, pokiri, billa, chirutha, ashok, anji, okkadu, balu, murari, gudumba, shankar, choodalani, undi, maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPQJoFNCgjU/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:12:25.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPQJoFNCgjU/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPQJoFNCgjU/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:36:12.750","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPQJoFNCgjU/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:12:25.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPQJoFNCgjU/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:48:38.250","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPQJoFNCgjU/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Pourudu","title_slug":"pourudu2008","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:44:25Z","video_ids":["4f8285494597ae39290000da"],"year":2008},{"_id":"4f82854b4597ae39290000dd","cast":["Sarada","Arjun","Rajani","Sarath Babu","Nutan Prasad","Gollapudi Maruthirao","Paruchuri GopalaKrishna","Chalapathi Rao"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:44:27Z","desc":"uresh Productions (Telugu: \u0c38\u0c41\u0c30\u0c47\u0c37\u0c4d \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c4a\u0c21\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c37\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c38\u0c4d) is a film production company founded by Dr. D.

His friends include an expatriate pygmy and two identical twins. You can't distinguish between them except that one of them mimics some famous actor whose name does not readily spring to mind. And another is distinguished by his habit of hanging around below a girl's balcony and making spectacularly suggestive gestures and facial expressions.\r\n\r\nWell, between hanging around with friends who carry horny tumescence to higher levels, and getting thrashed by his brute of a father, Chandu manages to fall in love with Vennella. Vennella (Kamini Jethmalani) is a terribly nubile, tumescence-inspiring, cherub-faced and pubescent-bodied babe who sashays around campus in her dazzling dresses with a constant and beatific smile on her face.\r\n\r\nThat really cocks up Chandu's plumage like nothing else does. He runs around after her in open-mouthed, tongue-dripping adoration, while she chastely spurns his physical advances, yet diplomatically accepting his spiritual ones (or whatever else he was offering).\r\n\r\nThe tumescence from this point on reaches an all-time high in the movie. The love affair is played out in a few poignant scenes of Chandu trying to feel her up or get a dressing room view while she is shopping for lingerie, and Venella chastising him like a sweet and indulgent convent school nun.\r\n\r\nThus their love builds up to new crescendos, and lots of fun is had. However, their love is not meant to be, which is something they both find out when Chandu decides to confront his father about it. His father spanks his muscled butt in a rather delightfully sudden and violent scene, and dispatches him off with a warning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Venella's parents also give off similar ominous signals, which effectively rule out her side of the confrontation. Moreover, Vennella is already engaged to her maternal uncle from the moment she was conceived... er... born, actually.\r\n\r\nSo C and V, unable to bear the possible future separation, decide to commit suicide together. This is the point at which the movie, in a brave new move of courageous new wave thinking, absolutely smashes all the clich\u00e9s of Indian cinema.\r\n\r\nChandu and Venella teeter on the edge of the terrace, exchanging their final words of love and hugs. There is shivering and fear and chattering and tears, but no miracle happens to stop them. They actually jump right off!\r\n\r\nAnd fall all the way down. On to a truck of sand. They are rushed to the hospital, treated, and get back their consciousness. But while their respective families are rejoicing and promising to get them both married if only they are okay, the news comes that both victims are suffering from 'retrograde amnesia'.\r\n\r\nNow this is said to mean that their brains are like a blank piece of paper unless all the previous memories are newly imprinted on them again. Now the two families are completely thrilled, and decide to get back to their own scheming ways and get them married elsewhere so the problem doesn't come up again.\r\n\r\nThe remaining part of the movie is about how they get back together, and which of all the possible miracles in the world comes to their rescue. There are clich\u00e9-smashers galore - like the scene where even though Chandu is back in her life, although they still don't remember the old times, Vennella actually gets married to her uncle. Down to the moodu mullu. No miracle stopping it here either.\r\n\r\nDirector Jaya, at her clever and innovative best, algorithmically pushes off all the miracles to an approximate hour after their due ISC (International Standard for Clich\u00e9s) time. With this foxy move, she raises the movie to new heights, where predictability...simply doesn't occur as predicted.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Premikulu is as forgettable as an 'issued in public interest' Doordarshan film for promoting condom use. Like one of those antithetical ads at primetime, it is sketchy, wryly titillating and makes you want to wash out the taste from your mouth afterwards.","duration":8079.0,"genres":["18","12"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Premikulu, Yuvraj, maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWPvExlMrSg/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:07:19.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWPvExlMrSg/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWPvExlMrSg/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:33:39.750","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWPvExlMrSg/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:07:19.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWPvExlMrSg/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:40:59.250","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWPvExlMrSg/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Premikulu","title_slug":"premikulu2005","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:44:44Z","video_ids":["4f82855c4597ae39290000f0"],"year":2005},{"_id":"4f82855e4597ae39290000f3","cast":["Laya","Sai Kiran","Roopa","Murali Mohan","Lakshmi"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:44:46Z","desc":"Preminchu (Telugu: \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c47\u0c2e\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c1a\u0c41) is a 2001 Telugu Drama film directed by Boyina Subba Rao and produced by D.

Pandu declines stating that he does not work for any gang, but is ready to do anything given enough money. Pandu falls in love with Shruthi when he visits his cousin's (Ajay) aerobics class, but she mistakes him for a thug. Shruthi, a college student, lives with her widowed mother and younger brother. Bramhi (Brahmanandam) lives above Shruthi's house, and frequently tries to convince Shruthi to marry him. Sub inspector Pashupathy (Ashish Vidyarthi), is a corrupt officer in the colony where Pandu and Shruthi live who often works with the land mafia. He is also on the payroll of Ali Bhai. He falls for Shruthi and decides to make her his mistress.\r\n\r\nPandu's first assignment with Ali's gang is to kill a member of Narayan's band. However, police show up at the spot where Pandu and the other gangsters are waiting. Pandu engages the cops long enough for the others to finish the task and flee. He also helps Shruthi escape from Pashupathy. She is impressed by his kindness and they develop unspoken romantic feelings for each other. When Shruthi tries to expresses her feelings they are attacked by members of Narayan's gang, whom Pandu finishes off. Shruthi is shocked to learn that Pandu is a gangster with no qualms about killing people.\r\n\r\nPashupathy arranges for some thugs to pretend to rape Shruthi, so that no decent family will want to take her as their daughter-in-law; with no other option Shruthi and her mother will accept his demands. Pandu learns of this and assaults Pashupathy incognito, warning him that if he is found responsible for this incident then things will turn ugly for him.\r\n\r\nAli Khan comes to Hyderabad and kills Narayan. He also meets Pandu to discuss the killing of a minister by blowing up a balloon. Pandu disagrees with Ali Bhai's method as it would involve killing innocents. In the middle of their argument police raid the club and arrest Ali Bhai. His gang members retaliate by creating a lewd video of the police commissioner's daughter and releasing it to media. They also kidnap her, forcing the police to release Ali Bhai. Ali Bhai drugs the commissioner's daughter, causing her to reveal that her father placed a mole in Ali Bhai's gang. They find that Pandu's uncle was a police inspector and the inspector's son, Krishna, is now a part of Pandu's gang. Ali Bhai kills Krishna in front of Pandu. However, it is revealed that the person who died was actually Ajay. The actual son of the retired inspector is Pandu. His father explains that Krishna has been masquerading as a corrupt mafia to penetrate the underworld gangs and wipe them out from the inside.\r\n\r\nKrishna/Pandu avenges his father's death by finishing off all members of Ali Bhai's gang including Ali Bhai and Pasupathy.\r\n\r\nthis film has been remade into tamil with vijay as Pokkiri, with salman khan in hindi as wanted","duration":9450.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Pokiri, Purijagannath, Maheshbabu, Iliyana, Manisharma, khaleja, athadu, athidi, raja, kumarudu, sainikudu, arjun, devdas, shakti, munna, kick, saleem, jalsa, rakhi, aata, kushi, takkari, donga, bavagaru, bagunnara, jai, chiranjeeva, tagore, kathi, don, seenu, billa, chirutha, ashok, anji, okkadu, balu, murari, gudumba, shankar, choodalani, undi, maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XIFbNVy3wPo/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:18:45","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XIFbNVy3wPo/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XIFbNVy3wPo/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:39:22.500","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XIFbNVy3wPo/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:18:45","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XIFbNVy3wPo/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:58:07.500","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XIFbNVy3wPo/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Pokiri","title_slug":"pokiri2006","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:45:32Z","video_ids":["4f82858c4597ae3929000120"],"year":2006},{"_id":"4f82858e4597ae3929000123","cast":["Sarath Kumar","Prakash Raj","Raghuvaran","Abhirami","Vadivelu","Nizhalgal Ravi","Sriman","Santhana Bharathi"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:45:34Z","desc":"This film deals with the issue of whether a man can be punished for the same crime twice.

He is racy both in his narration and in portraying the crucial role of ACP Parasuram. The theme is loosely based on how the innocent, helpless, educated and unemployed youngsters become vulnerable in the hands of terrorists who use them as human bombs. It is a brief story with plenty of situational and action drama. Dialogue is its strength, especially those lines written for Arjun's role. Akash, a terrorist, meticulously plans and executes subversion by brainwashing the disillusioned youth, Siva (Abbas) being one among them. Siva works against the government and the police as he strongly believes that the cops murdered his brother. It is now the turn of ACP Parasuram to set the record straight.\r\nAnjali (Kiran Rathod) and Meena (Gayatri Raghuram) lose their heart for the brave police officer. While the former admires him silently, the latter comes under his protection as there is a threat to her life. Parasuram helps Siva's mother, a widow, to regain their wealth and perform her daughter's marriage. How things change, and whether the cop succeeds in reforming the misguided youngsters are reserved for the end. The duel between Parasuram and Akash towards the end is a thrilling spectacle.","duration":6962.0,"genres":[],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Police Karthavyam, Full Length Telugu Movie, Police Karthavyam Movie, Telugu, Tone Tone TV, TeluguOne TeluguOne TV, Local TV Maa TV ETV, ETV2 News TV5 News, Tollywood Movies, Free Telugu Movies"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2X-BZ2Sp_f8/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:58:01","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2X-BZ2Sp_f8/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2X-BZ2Sp_f8/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:29:00.500","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2X-BZ2Sp_f8/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:58:01","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2X-BZ2Sp_f8/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:27:01.500","yt$name":"end"}],"title":"Police Karthavyam","title_slug":"police-karthavyam2003","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:45:36Z","video_ids":["4f8285904597ae3929000124"],"year":2003},{"_id":"4f8285924597ae3929000127","cast":["Roja","Raasi","Sridhar","Brahmanandam","M S Narayana","Ahuti Prasad","Ranganath","Satya Prakash"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:45:38Z","desc":"Roja and Raasi's Police Sister Movie - Full Length Telugu Movies With High Quality","duration":7162.0,"genres":[],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Police Sisters, Full Length Telugu Movie, Police Sisters Movie, Heroine Roja, Heroine Raasi, Satya Prakash, Manju - Babu Ganesh, M.s.

Prem and Vinod have sweethearts in Preeti and Sapna (Sonali Bendre and Karisma Kapoor), but the eldest son Vivek has always been shy and introverted due to a birth handicap. The family meets with Adarsh and his daughter Sangeeta (Rajeev Verma and Tabu), and decide to get Sangeeta and Vivek get married. Though Vivek protests in the beginning Sangeeta's love and devotion wins him over and they get married. After their wedding Mamta becomes insecure, assuming that Vivek (her step-son) would become selfish and take over the business and property. In order to protect Prem and Vinod, Mamta schemes with Dhanraj (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) to alienate Vivek from the property and inheritance. This divides the family, even though Vivek & Sangeeta accept Mamta's wishes and leave the house. Due to the unconditional love and respect for his elder brother, Prem quietly revolts against his mother's decision and changes her heart.

Any film associated with the name of Sankar is sure to have good opening. 'Kadal', directed by his disciple Saktivel and dubbed into Telugu with the title 'Premiste' and released on Dasara day, is an example. It has good opening of the type never seen for a Telugu dubbing of a Tamil film in recent time. The word 'Premiste' drew the attention of mostly youth. \r\n\r\nThe film opened with an introduction that was based on a true story that happened in Tamilnadu, Therefore the tragic end of that incident is retained in the film too and ended with a bit of dramatization. \r\n\r\nHalf of the film is flashback of a love story that led a pair elope and made the girl recall their past, as they travel in a bus. All the events that happened till then is narrated in the format. Like a news bit this film too has brief story that does not last even a couple of paragraphs if published as a news item. The girl Iswarya falls in love with a motor cycle mechanic Murali. Unaware of this, the girl's family arranges the marriage of Iswarya with another man of their choice. Almost when betrothal is being fixed, a disturbed Iswarya runs to her lover and encourages him for eloping as the only way left for them. And they do. She recalls these events in their journey to a hide out. where Murali's trusted friend lives. They stay at a place and get married urgently with his help. That is when her father and his henchmen trace the whereabouts and then drag them back to their home, beat the man to pulp and force their girl to marry another man. The film's last scene is a moving one in which Iswarya with a child in her lap traveling as pillion rider on her husband's motor bike, notices a heavily bearded lunatic on the road. She discovers he is her lover. She gets down and weeps shouting that she is responsible for his fate. And the story ends showing her husband taking the lunatic Murali along with them. \r\n\r\nYou can understand that there is no hero or a heroine in this plot. It is more a documentary of a particular incident woven into the format of a moving film. Pathos is the base mood of the drama. But the screenplay is so crisp that it leaves no dull moment for audience to relax. Songs keep to the basic emotion of the drama. \r\n\r\nBharat, a young talent, plays well the character suiting his age. New face Sandhya simply dominates the show. And the actor who plays Murali's friend also shares that pathos. There is a boy's role, working in Murali's mechanic shop. Scenes showing the boy spitting into a teacup or urinating into a Cola bottle and then serving them to Murali's friend are quite crude and tasteless. \r\n\r\nThe artistes playing parents and relatives and friends on either side of the lovers offered good performances. However the film oozes out only the Tamil nativity. Tamil newspapers, Tamil hoardings and so on are more in number. The artistes too look so. However, the story at one stage is shown shifted to Chennai. From that point one assimilates the narration. The climax given to the theme is semi tragic, because none of these lovers die. Yet the way the story brought to quick finish without preparing the audience for such a climax, which is debatable.","duration":8686.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Bharat, Sandhya, Sukumar, Arunkumar, Dondapani, Saravanan, Kannan, Bike Bhairavi, Autograph Alex, exclusive, maa movies, maa junior, maa music, maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOdCZ2--AdE/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:12:23","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOdCZ2--AdE/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOdCZ2--AdE/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:36:11.500","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOdCZ2--AdE/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:12:23","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOdCZ2--AdE/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:48:34.500","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOdCZ2--AdE/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Premiste","title_slug":"premiste2005","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:46:06Z","video_ids":["4f8285ae4597ae3929000143"],"year":2005},{"_id":"4f8285b04597ae3929000146","cast":["Balakrishna","Sharada","Kongara Jaggaiah","Nutan Prasad"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:46:08Z","desc":"This comedy entertainer President Gari Abbayi  directed by Tatineni Rama Rao has a very good story background which casts    Bala Krishna & Suhasini includes an awesome music given by Chakravarthy.\r\n\r\nPlease like & subscribe here\uf04a\r\nTo watch latest movie trailers, songs & videos click here\r\nwww.youtube.com/telugufilmnagar  \r\n\r\nTo watch latest movies click here\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/mangoVideos \r\n\r\nTo watch video clips click here\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/shemarootelugu\r\n\r\nTo watch new talent & short film videos click here\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/khelpedia\r\n\r\nTo watch Amrutham Serial Episodes click here\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/amruthamserial","duration":8547.0,"genres":["18","4","6"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["hot suhasini movies, President Gari Abbayi songs, indian family cinema, bala krishna movies, hot suhasini hot videos, chakravarthy music, Telugu full movies, Balakrishna, Simha, Sri Rama Rajyam, indian cinema"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/G5hm2MzeWHg/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:11:13.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/G5hm2MzeWHg/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/G5hm2MzeWHg/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:35:36.750","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/G5hm2MzeWHg/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:11:13.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/G5hm2MzeWHg/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:46:50.250","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/G5hm2MzeWHg/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Presidentgari Abbayi","title_slug":"presidentgari-abbayi1987","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:46:08Z","video_ids":["4f8285b04597ae3929000145"],"year":1987},{"_id":"4f8285b24597ae3929000148","cast":["Arun Kumar","Raasi","Prakash Raj","Costumes Krishna","Vadivelu","Kavitha","Sangeetha","Jyothi Meena"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:46:10Z","desc":"Amar and Preethi love each other but the rivalry between their fathers create problems in their love life.

Her friend Vaishnavi (Ranjani Ramakrishnan) always accompanies her as a violinist. Swarnalata had a dream to perform a concert in a city, away from her remote village. She gets an opportunity and both Swarnalata and Vaishnavi start their journey in a bus to the city along with their children. However, the bus meets with an accident and falls from the bridge into a river. Vaishnavi and Swarnalata's son die in the mishap. But it turns a nightmare for Swarnalata. After 20 years... Vaishnavi's son Abhinay (Prakash Rao) who used to make jingles wants to prove the real artiste in him instead of wasting his time for these petty things. He happens to meet Swarnalata, but she fears that Abhi would blame her for the death of his mother.\r\nAccidentally Priyanka alias Pinky (Perizaad Zorabian) meets Abhi in the same village and decides to encourage him. They gather two more upcoming artistes, a jazz (drums player) and a guitarist and start a musical troupe. But they could not meet the expectations. Vexed over the defeat, Abhi returns to the village and pleads with Swarnalatha to come and sing in their group. First she refuses, but later relents. However, she could not make it to the programme as fear continues to haunt her while crossing the bridge. Then, she decides to train Pinky in Carnatic music. Besides their passion for music, Swarnalatha, Abhi and Pinky also share something else - the old accident on the bridge. It is Pinky's father, who in an inebriated condition, drives his car in a reckless way and causes the accident.\r\nPinky gets complete training in Carnatic music and the group is all set to perform on the stage. But Abhi and Pinky want Swarnalata to come and sing in their group, which she refuses. To their surprise Swarnalata attends the programme and at the instance of Pinky Swarnalata starts singing. The specialty of the stage performance is the right blend of Carnatic and western music, called fusion music. The film ends on a happy note with the fulfillment of Swarnalata's dream to perform in the city and Abhi's dream of blending the classic and western music in right sync.","duration":5370.0,"genres":[],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Raagam Movie, Full Length Telugu Movies, Raagam Telugu Movie, Hero Prakash Kovelamudi, Prakash Kovelamudu, K.

The ego becomes bigger than him after marriage that he cannot see anything else in life.\r\n\r\nGopalam, a lawyer by profession, falls in love with Radha (Sneha). She being a judge's daughter is also a lawyer in the making. It is Gopalam who helps Radha become a lawyer.\r\n\r\nBut post marriage, the husband is not so sure of himself.

At his office, he meets Renuka 'Renu', the woman who earlier mistook him, who has newly joined as Article Editor. Saraswathi 'Saro' (Piaa Bajpai) also works in his office who has feelings for Ashwin. After finding out that Ashwin likes Renuka, she sacrfices her love.\r\n\r\nVasanthan Perumal (Ajmal Ameer), a recent graduate and engineer, strives hard to enter the political field. He is in contest against his rivals who capture the people at the time of elections by giving freebies and money. No one cares about Vasanthan and his team of graduates, who promise a healthy government to people. Their group name happens to be 'Siragugal'.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Renuka writes a cover story about politician Aalavandhan (Kota Srinivasa Rao), describing his attempt to marry a minor. Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renuka. The audio recording of her interview disappears, and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin now risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan who actually engages in child marriage. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Renuka to fall in love with him.\r\n\r\nVasanthan organizes a political campaign meeting. Ashwin receives a text message from Saro that states there is a bomb underneath the stage where Vasanthan and his political party is. Ashwin manages to save Vasanthan, while he finds Saro seriously injured and fighting for her life amidst the riot, eventually dies from her injuries.\r\n\r\nAshwin, through a video clip recorded by another photographer, finds out that Saro was intentionally killed by someone. He later notices a resemblance between the leader of the bank robbery and this unknown killer, concluding that it is the same person.\r\n\r\nVasanthan wins in the elections taking majority, gaining the title of Central Minister and his party raises to the secretariat. He orders the release of 20 naxals on Republic Day, citing humanity. Hearing this, Ashwin rushes to meet Vasanthan. In Vasanthan's office, he finds the leader of the bank robbery who had also killed Saro. He tells Vasanthan about it, but he ignores him and pretends to be busy. Ashwin then follows the leader to his hideout.At the same time, the CM (Vasanthan) orders Tamil Nadu Police to go kill the naxals at the address Vasanthan gave and the Police Commandos surrounds the perimeter. There he learns that it was Vasanthan who, with the help of the naxals, planted the bomb and killed Saraswati as she saw the bomb being planted. In the end Vasanthan gets killed by a blast. Ashwin never reveals the relationship between Vasanthan and the killer to the media. Ashwin feared that if he does so, other party members who won along with Vasanth in election will lose their seats because of people. Ashwin tells the press that Vasanth sacrificed himself to kill the naxals.","duration":9939.0,"genres":["18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Rangam, Jeeva, Ajmal, Ameer, Karthika, Nair, Piaa, Bajpai, Prakash, Raj, Kota, Srinivasa, Rao, Sona, Heiden, Suresh, Pattimandram, Raja, Jegan, Bose, Venkat, Anthony, maatv, maa, serials, movies, music, entertainment"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytu9C3tutI8/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:22:49.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytu9C3tutI8/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytu9C3tutI8/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:41:24.750","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytu9C3tutI8/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:22:49.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytu9C3tutI8/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"02:04:14.250","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytu9C3tutI8/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Rangam","title_slug":"rangam2011","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:47:06Z","video_ids":["4f8285ea4597ae392900017b"],"year":2011},{"_id":"4f8285ec4597ae392900017e","cast":["Chandra Mohan","Anjali Devi","Ram Mohan","Vanisri","Tyagaraaju","Kakarala","Vijaya Nirmala","Pushpavalli"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:47:08Z","desc":"Rangula Ratnam is the story about changing relations between family members according to the changing financial status.Suryam and Vasu are brother's.

The story begins with Roja fervently wishing that her sister\\'s marriage proposal get accepted successfully. The prospective suitor is top cryptologist Rishi Kumar (Arvind Swamy), who is set to arrive in the village soon. It soon emerges that Roja\\'s sister is in love with another, and to everyone\\'s surprise Rishi requests Roja\\'s hand in marriage. Being unaware of her sister\\'s love affair, Roja is not willing to accept Rishi\\'s proposal as she believes that he is the best match for her sister. But due to her parent\\'s pressure, she gets married to Rishi, and the couple move out of the village to live in Madras. Initially Roja is angry with Rishi for rejecting her sister, but when she comes to know of her sister\\'s love affair and consequent rejection of Rishi, she apologizes and starts seeing him in a new light. Love blossoms, and life is blissful for the couple for a short while. Meanwhile, Rishi is assigned a posting at an army communications center in Kashmir as part of his job- he works for the Indian government. All of a sudden, the couple find themselves in a beautiful, yet alien land. And Roja\\'s world turns upside down when Rishi is abducted by the terrorists whose agenda is to separate Kashmir from India and to free their leader, Wasim Khan- he\\'s being held by the Indian military forces due to his crimes. Faced with the daunting task of rescuing her husband, Roja runs from pillar to post, pleading with politicians and the military for help. Further complicating matters is the communication gap- she can\\'t speak their language, and they can\\'t speak hers. Consequently, all her efforts to apprise them of her suffering and pain prove to be futile. Now all alone in her battle to save her husband in an unfamiliar place from ruthless terrorists, with rising odds against her, will Roja succeed? What happens to Rishi and Wasim Khan?

He is an ACP and believes that law and order must be maintained at all times, however he is more of a peace lover and strongly believes that anyone who has done something wrong can be taken to task under the purview of justice and book of law without using any special methods. This also makes him feel repulsive about the encounter methods. However things take a turn when a well known politician (Kota) wants to get on to the chair of the Chief Minister and in this process, he hires a contract killer and gives him a list of names that have to be killed. However, he has a shock of his life when he gets news from the killer that someone else is already on the job without his involvement. Sathyam is given the assignment of nabbing the culprit and finally he manages to arrest Prathap (Upendra) who ironically is an ex cop himself but then he does not believe in the law system since he gets betrayed professionally. The ideology clash between Sathyam and Pratap goes to a peak and then the hero decides to put an end to this by proving his point. Is he successful in his mission?

An old, honest head constable Ayyappan (Thilakan), dismissed from service because he stretched his ideals too far, wants his son Sanjeev (Pritviraj) to become a police officer.\r\n\r\nOur hero is made of sterner stuff.

He deals with the corrupt with an iron fist; sings love songs with his sweetheart on the beaches, and mouths bombastic dialogue about the society's weak morality.\r\n\r\nPrithviraj impresses as Sanjeev Kumar. His stylistic performance looks attractive. The only point he should be careful about is his dialogue delivery because his voice seems to tear off when he has to deliver loud monologues.\r\n\r\nOthers of the cast, including heroine Priyamani, have little scope to show their histrionic capabilities. They have to be either very loud or extraordinarily subdued.\r\n\r\nSongs act as speed breakers in this fast movie.

Circumstances lead her into prostitution, and in the brothel she meets Srinivas (Kamal Haasan). He realizes that she has been tricked into the trade. He rescues her and takes her to his home in Ooty and begins to take care of her like his own. He knows Bhagyalakshmi as Viji, which was the pseudonym given for her at the brothel. Viji reciprocates Srinivas's care as they spend several months together sharing an amazing and innocent relationship that treads the tender line between affection and love. The sub plot of the film follows the wife of Srinivas' boss who is attracted to Srinivas, though Srinivas doesn't reciprocate her feelings. It depicts how the outside world succumbs to human feelings of lust and desire which are totally missing between Srinivas and Viji.

Narasimham settles every dispute in his town patiently with his words of wisdom and resorts to force only when the situation demands it. Kavya (Anushka), a city girl who comes on vacation to Razole, falls in love with Narasimham. Jamadagni (Vivek), Narasimham's bumbling colleague and friend, often accompanies him.\n\nEverything seems to be smooth-running until Vizag-based Purushottam (Prakash Raj), a big-time extortionist with shady mafia dealings, is required to travel to Razole to sign a conditional bail. Purushottam sends one of his henchmen to sign in his place. An angry Narasimham demands that Purushottam come in person for the signature and this starts tensions between them. Purushottam, unable to do anything because the town is under the control of Narasimham and his supporters, leaves humiliated. He uses his political clout to get Narasimham promoted to Inspector and transferred to Seetammadhara police station in Vizag in order to extract revenge.\n\nIn Vizag, Kavya's sister Divya is kidnapped by Vaaganam, and in the process Narasimham uncovers a scam run by Purushottam in which he kidnaps children for ransom from commercial real estate developers. Narasimham, with unexpected help from the Home Minister (Vijayakumar), gets promoted to Assistant Commissioner of the specially-formed Anti-kidnapping Task Force. Also, Kavya's father (Nassar) who was hostile to Narasimham following an altercation with Narasimham's father, softens up and agrees to give him Kavya's hand in marriage.\n\nIn a protracted cat-and-mouse chase with liberal display of muscle power, Purushottam targets people dearest to Narasimham, including Kavya (who gets shot but is saved by Narasimham) and manages to kill Narasimham's loyal deputy and close friend, Inspecter Ravi. Finally, in a bid to escape gathering momentum of hostility and the arrest warrant against him, Purushottam kidnaps the Karnataka Home Minister's daughter and escapes by train to Orissa. Following a fierce chase and fight, mobilizing a huge army of policemen to help him, Narasimham kills Purushottam in a final one-to-one fight. The final scene shows Narasimham and Kavya heading back to Razole, when Narasimham is stopped briefly by the Home Minister and assigned an undercover mission, to which he gladly agrees.","duration":8582.0,"genres":["18","1"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Yamudu, Singham, Ajay, Devgn, Rohit, Shetty, Hari, singam, Surya Sivakumar, Anushka Shetty, Prakash Raj, Nassar, Vivek, Manorama, Radha Ravi, Vijayakumar, Krishna Priya, Bose Venkat, Nizhalgal Ravi, Yuvarani, Ezhil Kumaran, maatv, telugu, tollywood"],"language":2,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugiANaZQSkI/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:11:31","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugiANaZQSkI/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugiANaZQSkI/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:35:45.500","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugiANaZQSkI/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:11:31","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugiANaZQSkI/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:47:16.500","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugiANaZQSkI/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Yamudu","title_slug":"yamudu2010","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:52:50Z","video_ids":["4f8287424597ae39290002c5"],"year":2010},{"_id":"4f8287434597ae39290002c8","cast":["VikRam","Sri Harsha","Babu Mohan","Tanikella Bharani","Nutan Prasad","M S Narayana","Sivaji Raja","Srilakshmi"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:52:51Z","desc":"Vikram and Sri Harsha's Youth Full Length Telugu Movies With High Quality","duration":7367.0,"genres":[],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Youth Movie, Full Length Telugu Movie, Vikram's Youth, Hero Vikram, Heroine Sri Harsha, Sishva, Lahari, Babu Mohan, Bharani, MS Narayana, Sri Lakshmi, Sivaji Raja, Vikram Telugu Movie, Banner Sri Sivakesawa Films, Producer Bhajarang Yadav, Director G.

Parvati wanted to give the mango to her children, Ganesh and Karthik. But since the mango could be eaten by only one of them due to Narada's condition, a competition was arranged between Ganesha and Karthik.

In order to appease the Lord of Gods, Indra, custodian of rain, a grand fire sacrifice is being conducted at the palace under the guidance of the Chief Priest, Paravasu. As this sacrifice draws to its close, our story begins.\n\nParavasu is the elder son of the great sage Raibhya. For seven years he has watched over the holy fire, forsaking his wife, family and every earthly pleasure. Paravasu's younger brother Arvasu is in love with a tribal girl, Nittilai. Arvasu prepares to marry outside his Brahmin caste. Paravasu's cousin and bitter rival, Yavakri, has just returned triumphant after ten years of practicing austerities in the jungle, with the gift of universal knowledge from the gods. He is resentful of Paravasu's position of Chief Priest, rekindling the existent rivalry between the two families. To seek revenge, and assert his position and dominance in the Brahmin community, he seduces Paravasu's abandoned wife Vishakha. Raibhya, Paravasu's father, wreaks his own vengeance on Yavakri by unleashing  upon him a demon - the Brahmarakshas. This sets off an irrevocable chain of events...\n\nThe film is adapted from the play, 'The Fire and the Rain' by one of India's foremost playwrights, Girish Karnad. The story is derived from the myth of Yavakri, which is a part of the great Indian epic, the Mahabharata. The film was shot entirely on location at Hampi, a World Heritage site that is under the stewardship of the Archeological Survey of India. Though considerably altered by the playwright, the story incorporates the essence of the story as told to us in the Mahabharata. The production of the film has retained the period aspect without losing the immediacy of contemporary insights that are so much a part of the script.","duration":7795.0,"genres":["18","6"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Agnivarsha, Drama, Fantasy, Play, Girish, Karnad, Amitabh, Bachchan, Jackie, Shroff, Nagarjuna, Raveena, Tandon, Milind, Soman, Prabhu, Deva, Mohan, Agashe, Kumar, Iyengar, Sonali, Kulkarni, Deepti, Bhatnagar, Mahabharat, Arjun, SajnaniThe, Fire, and, The, Rain, Idream, Production, Jajantaram, Mamantaram, Naina, 16, December, Samay, Straight, Monsoon, Wedding, Bollywood, Hollywood, Indian, Cinema, Epic, Raghuvir, Yadav, Nikita, Athena, Rajwade, hindi, india, songs, Love, Romance, Demons, Prayer"],"language":1,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZYHM_3V0aQ/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:04:57.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZYHM_3V0aQ/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZYHM_3V0aQ/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:32:28.750","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZYHM_3V0aQ/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:04:57.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZYHM_3V0aQ/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:37:26.250","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZYHM_3V0aQ/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Agni Varsha","title_slug":"agni-varsha2002","updated_at":"2012-04-09T06:59:01Z","video_ids":["4f8288b54597ae394400001f"],"year":2002},{"_id":"4f8288b74597ae3944000022","cast":["Akshay Kumar","Kareena Kapoor","Priyanka Chopra","Amrish Puri","Paresh Rawal","Anu Kapoor","Upasna Singh","Firoze Irani"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T06:59:03Z","desc":"Synopsis: The team of Akshay 'Khiladi' Kumar & Abbas-Mastan is back with its latest project Aitraaz.

Not all the riches in the world can compensate for the vaccum, the emptiness, created by the want of a child in a home. With a woman this yearning is a hundred times stronger and the outcome of her torment impossible beyond measure. Radha belonged to a rich family. Her sole aim in life after becoming a widow, was to see her sone Ajit happy and fulfil the promise she had given to her husband that the family name and tradition would be perpetuated. Finding Ajit deeply in love with Shobha, the Raisaheb's daughter who too loved him no less, Radha got them married, hoping that Shobha would prove an ideal wife and daughter-in-law and their home would soon resound with merry laughter of a child, if not children. Three years went by and Radha was still waiting for the new arrival in the family. Her patience was running out. Desperate, she took Shobha to a doctor who, after prolonged examination and treatment, told her that God alone could help her fulfil her yearning for a grandchild. Radha's sorrow knows no bounds. She could not think of the family chain breaking off. She had to have a grandchild and fulfil her promise to her late husband. As a last resort, she took Shobha to Gurudev, the spiritual soul revered by the family. Gurudev had pity on Radha's plight. Taking her into confidence, he told her: \"\"Look, I am no miracle worker. And, as far as my knowledge goes, I am certain that your daughter-in-law is destined to remain barren.\"\"When Shobha heard this, she was in a daze. She knew her mother-in-law's craving for a grandchild and she knew also that woman would leave no stone unturned to accomplish her objective.Life seemed to Shobha without a ray of hope for her to live. She decided to put an end to it. It was better that way, she thought, than to suffer the humiliation of being branded for ever barren.

His Father was a gangster who wanted to reform. On assurance from his friend Inspector Joseph, Jai's father agreed to rat on his evil bosses. Inspector Joseph guaranteed him that he would find Jai's father and Jai a safe passage into the world of good once his bosses have been exposed. \r\n\r\nBut the unexpected happened. Jai witnessed the fatal double cross on his father, despite his confession, by a senior police officer. Joseph's valiant effort to save him went in vain. This traumatic incident left a lasting impression on Jai's mind that there was no point in being good and that 'It's Good to be Bad.'\r\n\r\nJoseph adopted Jai out of guilt and tried to instill his Christian values of finding a God within but the memories from the past had already cast themselves deep in Jai's mind. Despite repeated attempts to reform him, Joseph failed to ignite the light of good within Jai's soul. And when matters went almost completely out of hand with Jai's checkered criminal life, Joseph arranged an alternate identity for him as Suraj Bhardwaj and sent him away to Australia - a land far away from his past.\r\n\r\nJai had promised Joseph in Australia he would stay clear of any trouble. It was a golden chance to feel the grass on the other side of the fence. Almost immediately after landing Jai met Suhani, an Indian Australian with an unadulterated honest vision of 'one world'. Although she hailed from a conservative traditional Punjabi family that took pride in being Indian, Suhani secretly fostered a much liberal outlook towards life. Her elder brother Samarth was just the opposite. Samarth was convinced that Australians had a one-point agenda to bring Indians down.\r\n\r\nJai found his home with the bumbling punju boys GoldE and gang. They were happy go lucky 'sardar' boys who knew that the ticket to heaven was through attaining a permanent residency in Australia. GoldE almost echoed Joseph's voice when he warned Jai to stay out of trouble and concentrate on his work - he arranged for Jai to get a job as a taxi driver in Samarth's garage.\r\n\r\nSuhani was intrigued by Jai's manner. He was flirting but with a flair. He was lying but in style and he was conniving but with a pure heart. She could spot in the first instant that she met Jai that beyond his prankster, lying front Jai had a deeper side to himself that Jai refused to acknowledge. Jai knew that if he could make Suhani fall in love with him he could eventually attain permanent residency by marrying her but her brother was too much of an obstacle. So while Jai was busy scheming for Suhani's love he was also flirting with Nicole, the stripper from a nearby strip club. But his problems with Nicole were almost similar to Suhani's as Nicole's brother, Russel, was a rowdy skinhead from the block. Jai had sworn to Joseph that he would not get his hands in any racket but trouble followed Jai He found himself at a crossroad where he was left with no other option but to take a fair stand. It was a time when he had to figure whether it's Good to be bad or it is Good to be Good.","duration":7165.0,"genres":["18","6","11"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Crook, Crook It's Good to Be Bad, official, full movie, action, drama, thriller, indian, movie, Emraan Hashmi, kiss, hot, actress, Neha Sharma, Arjan Bajwa, Mashhoor Amrohi, Kavin Dave, Mohit Suri, Ankur Tewari, Pritam Chakraborty, Pritam, bollywood, cinema, bollywoodbackstage, desimad"],"language":1,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/URxt9Wbwf5E/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:59:42.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/URxt9Wbwf5E/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/URxt9Wbwf5E/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:29:51.250","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/URxt9Wbwf5E/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:59:42.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/URxt9Wbwf5E/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:29:33.750","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/URxt9Wbwf5E/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Crook","title_slug":"crook2010","updated_at":"2012-04-09T07:03:47Z","video_ids":["4f8289d34597ae3944000129"],"year":2010},{"_id":"4f8289d54597ae394400012c","cast":["Sanjay Dutt","Chandrachur Singh","Mahima Chaudhary","Sushma Seth","Shakti Kapoor","Mohan Joshi","Deepak Shirke","Harish Patel"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T07:03:49Z","desc":"Ravi Verma is an unprincipled lawyer, who will bend the law to seek an acquittal for his clients.

What is expected from two top action heroes who are good in emotion and comedy is not served here in this film. Box office is the only target of the team of this film. Entertainment and age old theory in the wafer thin subject line is not enough with two powerful stars together. Chinnu and Chakri (Shivarajkumar and Upendra) are perfect deal masters. Earning money is their sole intention. Chinnu works for powerful don (played by Sayaji Shinde) whose daughter is Sara (Jennifer Kotwal). Chinnu saves Sara from difficult situation on a few occasions and as expected she is in love with Chinnu. On the other hand Chakri has a perfect match in Sinchana (Charmee). Both are living by duping people.

Man does not live by bread alone; man's life is not complete without love and without friendship. It is the bond of affection between man and man that has contributed to the progress of mankind since time immemorial. \"Dosti\" is the story of two teenage boys drawn together by fate and friendship, which is both heart-warming and inspiring. Orphan, lame, Ramu searched for a job and wandered in the street. One day he saw a boy crossing a street unmindful of the approaching car. He rushed and saved the boy only to find out that Mohan was blind. Mohan told him that in childhood, he had fallen sick and lost his eye-sight. He had a sister who had left the village to become a nurse and get him cured. Due to floods he had come to the city in search of his sister. Ramu and Mohan, facing the same cruel fate, become friends and decide to fight the battle of life together. One day Ramu was playing a tune on his mouth organ. It attracted some passers-by who gave him money mistaking him for a beggar. Ramu felt humiliated; but Mohan consoled him, saying that people were paying him for his music. Mohan, who had a melodious voice, sang and together they made a good team of entertainers and earned their livelihood. Ramu's interest in studies and his promise to his mother that he will complete his studies and become something in life inspired Mohan to convince his friend to join the school again. Mohan promised to raise the money. With some difficulties Ramu got himself admitted in the school. Sharmaji, a school teacher finding him a brilliant student, became his god-father.

Whenever the mankind suffers and is at the mercy of the tyrant, the Lord takes birth to demolish the forces of the evil. Thus, when the people of Mathura were tyranised and tortured by Kansa who threw his parents in jail and killed seven children of his sister Devaki, the Lord took birth as Krishna in the prison. And before Kansa could destroy his sister's eight child born to kill him, he was taken away to Gokhul where he was brought up as the son of Nand and Yashoda. When Kansa came to know that his enemy was growing up in Gokul, he sent one demon after another to kill him. But instead, Putana, Kaliya and all other demons were destroyed by Krishna. Ultimately kansa sent Akrura to bring Gopal Krishna to Mathura-little knowing that he was inviting his own death! To save his life Kansa used every magic that he knew to entice Krishna. But, alas, all his tricks failed and in the battle of wits as well as guts that ensured between them Kansa, the tyrant met his death at the hands of his nephew Lord Krishna. This is the first time that the legendry colourful story of Lord Krishna from his birth to the destruction of demon Kansa is being presented in Cinemascope an colour in all its splendour set to tuneful music.

He says he isn't married. But he is. Mr Rai has a daughter with a heart condition. She's confined to a wheelchair but Mohan has more than a mild therapeutic effect on her and she is soon up and running - running after him. Meanwhile, back in the village, the money he has been sending home is being filched by his greedy sister.

It is this move that will compel Jaswant to force Dr. Khanna to withdraw this complaint by making it clear that if he cannot have Anju for himself then he will ensure that she becomes 'public property' - and he will arrange her to be sold to a brothel - and then transported to Dubai.","duration":6256.0,"genres":["5","6","18"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["LANKA, official, full movie, action, drama, crime, indian, movie, Manoj Bajpai, Arjan Bajwa, Tia Bajpai, Yashpal Sharma, Shweta Salve, Vikram Bhatt, Maqbool Khan, bollywood, cinema, bollywoodbackstage, desimad"],"language":1,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9y4Q9nh9MIs/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:52:08","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9y4Q9nh9MIs/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9y4Q9nh9MIs/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:26:04","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9y4Q9nh9MIs/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:52:08","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9y4Q9nh9MIs/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:18:12","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9y4Q9nh9MIs/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Lanka","title_slug":"lanka2011","updated_at":"2012-04-09T07:13:04Z","video_ids":["4f828c004597ae394400030f"],"year":2011},{"_id":"4f828c034597ae3944000312","cast":["Dharmendra","Mumtaz","Roopesh Kumar","Mukri","K N Singh","Padma Khanna","Iftekhar","Faryal"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T07:13:07Z","desc":"Super Hit movie Loafer (1973) \r\nSynopsis:\r\nLoafer is the interesting tale of a criminal, turned playboy, turned lover whose past comes to haunt him when life seemed to be completing a circle.\r\n\r\nRanjit (Dharmendra) is a flamboyant, charming and rich playboy who is also well-known as the Loafer.

The story starts off in India where Ashok (Joy Mukherji) is being pressured to marry a woman he doesn't love. His elderly mother asks him to travel to Tokyo to pick up his eight year old nephew, a recently orphaned boy named Chikoo whom Ashok has never met because his family disowned his older brother after he married a Japanese woman. Ashok arrives in Tokyo only to discover that Chikoo has no intention of going to India, a country he has never seen before. Ashok hopes to win his nephew over by taking him on an expensive shopping trip, but the boy escapes when his attention is diverted by a beautiful woman named Asha (Asha Parekh), whom he sees performing a traditional Indian dance on television. Asha was also orphaned as a child and raised by her uncle in the Indian community of Tokyo. Asha's uncle wants her to marry a man she despises, a boorish, chain smoking airline pilot named Pran. Asha runs away after she discovers that the two men have cooked up a fiendish plot to get their hands on her sizable inheritance. Chikoo and Asha both end up in the same hiding place and form an alliance against their uncles. Asha protects the boy by posing as a bearded Sikh until she realizes that she has fallen in love with Ashok. She later pretends to be Chikoo's Japanese aunt in order to win Ashok's heart without being discovered. The movie has subplot involving a friend of Ashok's named Mahesh (popular comedian Mehmood) who comes to Tokyo to marry a woman from a higher class. There's a hilarious scene where Mehmood fools his potential father-in-law by posing as an \"International Geisha\" who just happens to speak Hindi fluently. Love in Tokyo contains the fast paced witty dialogue found in many Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn romantic comedies. It would have made an excellent 90 minute film but the actual length is almost twice that. The second half contains enough melodrama to fill a season of General Hospital and the ending is straight out of a James Bond movie. However it's important to remember that Bollywood is not Hollywood and moviegoers in each country have different expectations.\n\n\n\nThe film contains two of the most beloved songs from Indian cinema: \"Love in Tokyo\" by Rafi Mohamed and \"Sayonara\" by Lata Mangeshkar. The latter is the reason that Japanese tourists in India are often greeted with a cheery \"sayonara sayonara\".","duration":10086.0,"genres":["18","3","12"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Bollywood, Classic, Movie, Love, In, Tokyo, rajshri, Music, Old, Comedy, Hindi, Movies, Entertainment, sexy, watch, new, online, songs, download, scenes, hot, actress, indian, celebrity, gossip, tamil, english, subtitles, Color, parts, part, cinema, films, superstar, superhit, blockbuster, hit, scene, romance, romantic, desi, most, popular"],"language":1,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3bICPEr1qU/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:24:03","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3bICPEr1qU/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3bICPEr1qU/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:42:01.500","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3bICPEr1qU/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:24:03","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3bICPEr1qU/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"02:06:04.500","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3bICPEr1qU/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Love in Tokyo","title_slug":"love-in-tokyo1966","updated_at":"2012-04-09T07:13:12Z","video_ids":["4f828c084597ae3944000315"],"year":1966},{"_id":"4f828c0a4597ae3944000318","cast":["Dev Anand","Mala Sinha","Abhi Bhattacharya","Pranoti Ghosh","Sarita","Suresh","Vijay Kumar","Sailen Bose"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T07:13:14Z","desc":"Sunil Kumar (Dev Anand) is a star cricket player in his city of Jhansi and lives with his brother's family.

In the course of time, Ram Jaane (Shah Rukh Khan) becomes a criminal and Murali (Vivek Mushran) turns out to be a moral custodian of the street urchins. His Apna Ghar becomes a house for the homeless. When Ram Jaane comes out of the jail, Murli forcibly brings him to Apna Ghar hoping to reform him. However, what cheers RJ is the proximity of Bela (Juhi Chawla) after whom he lusts, being incapable of love. Though Bela is only being friendly towards him, Ram Jaane mistakes it for reciprocated love, not knowing that Bela loves Murli. Murli is aware of Ram Jaanes passion for Bela so he hides his feelings for her and pretends not to love her.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Ram Jaane in the basti affects the children in a manner Murli hadnt foreseen. Ram Jaanes flamboyant lifestyle begins tempting the young boys to follow in his footsteps and they start idolizing and imitating him.\r\n\r\nTo save the basti from the land-grabbing villains (Gulshan Grover, Pankaj Kapoor, Puneet Issar), Ram Jaane commits a crime, in the process involving two of the destitute boys.

However, Murli forces Bela to continue to see Ram Jaane as she is the only one who can reform him. Bela may have been successful in reforming Ram Jaane, but for the wily ways of the villains. It is alleged that Murli is training criminals in Apna Ghar for Ram Jaanes gang and all financial aid to the project is stopped. The children begin to stray when one lakh rupees arrive in cash.\r\n\r\nMurli knows from where the money has come, and he confronts Ram Jaane and finally the daggers are drawn between friends.

Throughout the movie, many twists occur including some as red herrings surrounding the mystery of Pooja's sudden death. There are frequent flashbacks of Pooja's past with both Rahul and Karan.\nAs the investigations go on, the audience finds out that Karan was Pooja's ex-boyfriend. Karan was brash and good-looking, but had a major flaw - he was obsessed with Pooja and violently jealous of anyone paying her any attention. Karan's flaw caused Pooja to initially fear him and eventually break up with him. He leaves town and she becomes a famous music performer and soon meets a handsome, loving, wealthy man, Rahul, who falls madly in love with her when since he saw her dance to the song, 'Zindagi ko Savar De Maula'. Pooja loves her husband very much and on their wedding night she promises she will never do anything to shame him, flashbacks are shown with a happy marriage which gets shattered when the couple are involved in a car accident, causing Rahul to go completely blind.\nKaran, unaware of Pooja's marriage to Rahul, as he left the country to make something of himself for Pooja to be proud ofso he could become worthy of Pooja's hand in marriage. When he comes back, he is heartbroken to find out that his ex-love is married and coincidently he had become a business partner and friend of Rahul. One day, Rahul takes Karan to his house, where Karan is in for a surprise as he sees Pooja! Pooja is shocked to see Karan, but makes it clear to him that she loves her husband and their relationship is definitely in the past.\nThe movie goes back to the present where an unknown man is trying to blackmail Karan as Pooja's jewelry is found in his drawer. To make matters worse, someone seems to be trying to kill Rahul! Pooja's body is stolen from the morgue and found cremated on the beach. After some investigations, the police take Karan to the police station. Eventually Karan is indicted, but denies his involvement as Pooja's former lover and stalker, even though he knows that he loved Pooja. Also, the fact that Rahul is, in fact, not blind is unveiled as he had an eye operation to cure his blindness, but he keeps up the act of being blind.\nKaran discovers that Rahul is trying to frame him, but he does not understand why, until a candid interview, when he's already been brought to jail, where Rahul reveals that Pooja committed suicide. After having his eye operation, when Rahul went to surprise Pooja, to his shock, he saw Pooja in the arms of Karan (when in fact she was struggling with him to release his grasp on her). Feeling betrayed, Rahul ignores Pooja, who wonders about the strange behavior of her husband. After Rahul indirectly reveals to Pooja that he has gained his eyesight by telling her to go to bed as it's late (she realises he can see the clock now), Pooja feels an overwhelming sense of guilt. She realizes that Rahul saw her and Karan together and feeling she's shamed her marriage she commits suicide the next morning. In a tape which Pooja leaves, she reveals all the truth to Rahul. Karan was Pooja's past and violently possessive boyfriend, whose obsession became the worst of him. Fearing his anger and craziness, Pooja decides to leave Karan, only to find him with Rahul. When Karan came back, he threatened Pooja by stating that if she doesn't cheat on her husband with him, then Karan shall kill the innocent Rahul. Fearing for Rahul's safety, Pooja decides to play along with Karan until she can figure out how to get out of the mess, only to make matters worse. Throughout the movie, Rahul was attempting to slowly get revenge on Karan for Pooja's death, because she committed suicide due to Karan's constant harrassment of her. If Karan didn't re-enter their lives and try to get Pooja back, then Pooja would never have felt she had to commit suicide. Rahul had arranged for Pooja's body to be taken from the morgue so he could cremate her body himself as well as to make the police think it wasn't suicide but murder as he plants evidence to show Karan was at the beach.\nThe film ends with Karan thinking he's recorded Rahul confessing to framing him but Rahul smiles and shows him the batteries from the recorder that he bribed someone to get for him as he guessed what Karan would try to do.","duration":7312.0,"genres":["18","1","12"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["Vada, Vaada, Bollywood Movie Vaada, Full Movie Vaada, Sexy Scene By Amisha Patel, Nude Amisha, Full Video of Movie Vaada, HD Print Movies, Latest Movies, Popular Movie Of Amisha Patel, Arjun Rampal Full Movies"],"language":1,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0XtrCa8OIws/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:00:56","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0XtrCa8OIws/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0XtrCa8OIws/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:30:28","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0XtrCa8OIws/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:00:56","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0XtrCa8OIws/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:31:24","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0XtrCa8OIws/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Vaada","title_slug":"vaada2005","updated_at":"2012-04-09T07:25:15Z","video_ids":["4f828edb4597ae3944000585"],"year":2005},{"_id":"4f828edd4597ae3944000588","cast":["Shammi Kapoor","Bina Rai","Nishi","Abhi","K N Singh","Maruti","Mohan Choti","Munshi Munakka"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T07:25:17Z","desc":"Kundan (Shammi Kapoor) is very poor and uses unsavory means to gain money to help the poor in his neighborhood.

Director Rajendra Babu can be credited as the captain for a film which is technically and musically superior. The film is entertaining and interesting in its own right. \"Yaare Neenu Cheluve\" almost reminds one of an old-world romance. Here the main hero Surya (Ravichandran) and Kamli (Sangeeta) fall in love and romance each other through letters without having seen or met each other even once. And the first time they meet and get to know each other is the climax of the film. This is the absorbing aspect of the film which keeps it going till then. Ramesh in an even more brief appearance as an aspiring suitor to the heroine, distinguishes himself for what he is a natural actor who can breathe life into every movement and emotion of his. Prakash Rai as the heroine's brother-in-law, makes a forceful impact. His larger-than-life screen presence and impressive dialogue delivery coupled with the nuances of expression make for some riveting and touching scenes in the film. It is worth making that trip to the theatre to see Rai if only for a while.One elementary aspect, which is the essence of the film, is the tender romance between the lovers.Hamsalekha's music enhances the mood of the film. The songs are celebratory: they are tuneful and more than pleasing, perhaps heralding Hamsalekha once again as a talent after a lean patch. D. V. Rajaram's cinematography lends a superior dimension to the film. \"Yaare Neenu Cheluve\" is a sleek production.","duration":8469.0,"genres":["18","4","6"],"is_3d":false,"is_hd":false,"keywords":["kannada, superhit, film, south, shemaroo, movie, full, length, free, online, download, song, dance, romantic, love, comedy, Tollywood, villian, video, Bollywood-action, Entertainment, Music, Hindi, funny, hot, HD, Indian, cinema, regional-indian-movies, yaare, neenu, cheluve, vishnuvardhan, ravichandran, Shree, Ganesh, Videos"],"language":5,"license":null,"link_slug":null,"paid_content":false,"price":null,"price_currency":null,"thumbnails":[{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9PpVF3QJnw/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:10:34.500","yt$name":"default"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9PpVF3QJnw/hqdefault.jpg","height":360,"width":480,"yt$name":"hqdefault"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9PpVF3QJnw/1.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"00:35:17.250","yt$name":"start"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9PpVF3QJnw/2.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:10:34.500","yt$name":"middle"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9PpVF3QJnw/3.jpg","height":90,"width":120,"time":"01:45:51.750","yt$name":"end"},{"url":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9PpVF3QJnw/movieposter.jpg","height":243,"width":169,"yt$name":"poster"}],"title":"Yaare Neenu Cheluve","title_slug":"yaare-neenu-cheluve1998","updated_at":"2012-04-09T07:35:26Z","video_ids":["4f82913e4597ae3975000179"],"year":1998},{"_id":"4f82914b4597ae397500017c","cast":["Kiron Kher","Chiranjeet","Sudipta Chakraborty","Surya Chatterjee","Rupa Ganguly","Abhishek Chatterjee","Shivprasad Mukerjee"],"created_at":"2012-04-09T07:35:39Z","desc":"Banalata (Kiron Kher) is a lonely woman who becomes just another victim of a supposed curse on the family.
